**Christmas Markets**

Many Norwegians tend to love the Christmas season. In fact, they kick
off the season in November actually, with Christmas markets. There are
many Christmas markets that pop up all around Norway. At these markets,
one can purchase all kinds of crafts, toys, and other goodies. Just be
forewarned that the items at the markets are not cheap. One popular
“market” is Pepperkakebyen in Bergen, where one can find the world’s
largest gingerbread town. (Pepperkakebyen isn’t technically a market,
but was listed among other markets).

**Saint Lucy’s Day**

On 13 December, many schools and kindergartens celebrate
[<span class="underline">Luciadag</span>](https://www.tv2.no/v/865340/)
(Saint Lucy’s Day). Saint Lucy was the Catholic Saint of Light. In
Catholicism, she is believed to have brought food and aid to Christians
that had been in hiding, and that she wore a wreath with candles on her
head, in order to light the way, keeping her hands free to carry the
food and supplies.

On Luciadag, young children sing as they parade through the schools,
nursing homes, and hospitals, wearing white clothes, simple head
wreaths, and holding candles. The girl at the front wears a white dress,
and a head wreath with candles on it. It is common for people to eat
lussekatter, which are saffron buns, for Luciadag.

**Julebord**

Julebord translates into “Christmas table.” A julebord is a gathering of
people, usually with coworkers, where lots of food is consumed and
alcohol is usually imbibed. Some of the foods commonly served at a
julebord include ribbe (pork ribs) with boiled potatoes; pinnekjøtt
(lamb ribs); or fish (depending on where one lives).

**Decorations**

Many Norwegians keep Christmas decorations simple, with such things as
candles, wreaths, angels, hearts, star lights, etc. Homemade decorations
are common. The colors used often are purple (during advent), white,
silver, gold, and red. Many have some sort of advent countdown to
Christmas, such as the adventsstake, which has 4 candles for each Sunday
of advent.

Some Norwegians put red tape over their windows to make little squares
(24 to represent each day of advent), and then put something in a square
each day during advent. Candy advent calendars are also common but some
have gift calendars.

The Christmas tree is usually a real tree, which often gets decorated
with tinsel, baubles, garland, and lights. The tree is generally topped
off with a either a silver or gold star rather than an angel. For some
families, the tree isn’t decorated until the 23rd (lille julaften or
little Christmas Eve).

**Christmas Eve & Day**

Norwegians do a lot of baking, the closer it gets to Christmas. On lille
julaften, many eat different cookies and cakes, krumkake and pepperkake
being popular. These baked goods are sometimes eaten on Christmas Eve,
at lunchtime.

Another popular thing to eat on either lille julaften or for lunch on
Christmas Eve is risengrynsgrøt which contains a whole almond and
whoever finds the whole almond in their bowl gets a marzipan pig.

Christmas Eve, or julaften, is the main day of celebration for
Norwegians. Some Norwegians attend a Christmas service on the 24th, even
if they aren’t religious. Dinner is usually around 5pm on the 24th, with
many Norwegians eating ribbe, served with things like brussel sprouts,
gravy, lingonberry jam, boiled white potatoes, red cabbage, apples,
figs, prunes, and often with medisterkaker and /or julepølse as well.
Meanwhile, others may choose to have pinnekjøtt, often served with
brussel sprouts, almond potatoes, carrots, red cabbage, surkål,
cauliflower, etc. Dessert is often riskrem (which is leftover rice
porridge with whipped cream) and red sauce, or caramel pudding. Juleøl,
aquavit and gløgg are common beverages but if one doesn’t drink alcohol,
one can drink julebrus, which is a sweet soda, or non-alcoholic gløgg.

There are two types of “julenisse.” There is the “julenisse” that is
essentially Santa Claus, with the red suit, black boots, white beard,
and red hat, bearing gifts. This “julenisse” didn’t really become part
of Norwegian traditions until end of the 1800s. Then there is a
julenisse who is a barn elf (also called fjøsnisse). He lives in the
barn and wears a long red hat and has a long white beard, but otherwise
really bears no resemblance to “Santa Claus.” Some children still leave
out porridge for this “julenisse,” on Christmas Eve, to keep him happy.

After dinner, it is common for Norwegians to sing and
“[<span class="underline">dance</span>](https://youtu.be/bSiEysL0ar0)”
(more like walking) around the tree together. Once that is over,
presents are then handed out, one at a time. If there are young children
living in the home, sometimes an adult will dress up as Santa and
deliver a few presents. Usually the opening of presents is a slow
process, with only one person opening a gift at a time.

Christmas day (første juledag) is typically quiet for most. The 26th,
which is andre juledag (“the second day of Christmas”), is when more
formal lunches and visits with other family members take place. During
the days following Christmas (romjul - 25 Dec to 30 Dec), some children
dress up and knock on doors, singing songs, asking for cookies. This is
called julebukk. In some locations, like Bergen, there is nyttårsbukk
instead, which happens on New Year’s Eve. It’s not as common as it once
was.
