Some verbs in Norwegian have more than one word that can be used, but
when to use which word can be difficult. Three examples are “to think,”
“to know,” and “to see.”

== Grammar Review

=== Sentence structure 

While most Norwegian sentences use the subject-verb-object (SVO) word
order, like English, Norwegian does have the V2 (verb second) rule. If
an adverbial phrase or subordinate clause is at the front of the
sentence, the subject and the verb have to switch places (this is called
“inversion”) so that the verb stays in the second position.

|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.2+|*SVO* |Sara lånte boka i går. |_Sara borrowed the book yesterday._

|Gustav reiste til Trondheim i løpet av ferien. |_Gustav travelled to
Trondheim during the holiday._

.2+|*V2* |I går lånte Sara boka. |_Yesterday, Sara borrowed the book._

|I løpet av ferien reiste Gustav til Trondheim. |_During the holiday,
Gustav travelled to Trondheim._

=== Verb Conjugation

Conjugating the present tense of verbs in Norwegian is fairly simple.
Most present tense verbs just add an -r to the end of the infinitive.

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*

|Å kjøre |Kjører |_Drives / Driving_ |Å spre |Sprer |_Spreads /
Spreading_

|Å sove |Sover |_Sleeps / Sleeping_ |Å forstå |Forstår |_Understands /
Understanding_
|===

There are some exceptions / irregulars:

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*
|Å kunne |Kan |To be able to |Å måtte |Må |To have to
|Å skulle |Skal |To have to; to be going to |Å ville |Vil |To want
|Å være |Er |_To be_ |Å vite |Vet |_To know_
|===

Past tense conjugation is a bit more difficult, however there are some
guidelines (but keep in mind there are exceptions).

[arabic]
. If the verb ends with a double consonant, consonant cluster, or voiced
plosive (b / d), past tense will end in -et. (or in -a, really, even in
BM)
. If the verb ends in a single consonant (except v / b / d), past tense
ends in -te.
. If the verb ends with v or diphthong, the past tense ends in -de.
. If the verb has only one syllable with a long vowel, past tense ends
in -dde.

|*Rule Number* |*Infinitive* |*Past Tense* |*English*
.2+|*1* |Å flytte |Flyttet |_Moved_
|Å danse |Danset |_Danced_
.2+|*2* |Å bake |bakte |_Baked_
|Å lese |leste |_Read_
.2+|*3* |Å lage |lagde |_Made_
|Å leie |leide |_Rented_
|*4* |Å spre |spredde |_Spread_
|===

There are two ways to talk about future activities. Sometimes a present
tense verb + a time adverbial is used. Another way to express future
“tense” is using a modal verb.

[cols=",,",]

| |*Eksempel* |*English*

|*Present Tense + Time Adverbial* |Emil drar til konserten neste helg.
|_Emil is going to the concert next weekend._

|*Modal Verbs* |Jon skal jobbe hjemmefra. |_Jon will work from home._
|===

=== Adjective Basics

Adjectives typically have to agree with the gender and the number of the
noun. If the noun is neuter gender, then in the singular indefinite
form, the adjective takes a *-t ending*. In the plural indefinite, the
adjective takes an *-e ending*. Note there are exceptions.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| 2.+|*Singular Indefinite* 2.+|*Plural Indefinite*

| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*

.2+|*Masculine* |En snill tanke |_A kind thought_ |Snille tanker |_Kind
thoughts_

|En søt katt |_A cute cat_ |Søte katter |_Cute cats_

.2+|*Feminine* |Ei snill melding |_A kind message_ |Snille meldinger |_Kind
messages_

|Ei søt mus |_A cute mouse_ |Søte mus |_Cute mice_

.2+|*Neuter* |Et snilt barn |_A kind child_ |Snille barn |_Kind children_

|Et søtt godteri |_A sweet candy_ |Søte godteri(er) |_Sweet candies_
|===

When the noun is in the definite form, the adjective takes an -e ending.

| 2.+|*Singular Definite* 2.+|*Plural Definite*

| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*

.2+|*Masculine* |Den snille tanken |_The kind thought_ |De snille tankene
|_The kind thoughts_

|Denne søte katten |_This cute cat_ |Disse søte kattene |_These cute
cats_

.2+|*Feminine* |Den snille meldinga |_The kind message_ |De snille
meldingene |_The kind messages_

|Denne søte musa |_This cute mouse_ |Disse søte musene |_These cute
mice_

|Dette søte godteriet |_This sweet candy_ |Disse søte godteria /
godteriene |_These sweet candies_

==  To Think

In English, “to think” is used in different ways, such as to ponder, to
give an opinion on something, and as another way to say “believe.”
Norwegian, however, has multiple words that are used in these
situations, and when to use them is kind of strict.

=== Å tenke 

* Used to mean to think; to ponder.
* It is referring to the mental process of thinking.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*

|Tenker du på henne ofte? |_Do you think of her often?_

|Tobias tenker på hunder hver dag. |_Tobias thinks about dogs every
day._

|Dan tenker på hender hver dag. |_Dan thinks about hands every day._

|Eg tenkjer på familien min i Amerika kvar dag. |_I think about my
family in America every day._
|===

=== Å tro 

* Used when one wants to express belief about something, however there
is some uncertainty.
* If, in English, you can replace “think” with “believe,” then this is
the word you need.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*

|Isabella tror at bursdagen hans er neste uke. |_Isabella thinks
(believes) his birthday is next week._

|Markus trodde at moren hans ville være hjemme før kl. 7. |_Markus
thought (believed) that his mom would be home before 7pm._

|Jeg tror han vet mest om dette programmeringsspråket. |_I think he
knows the most about that Programming language._
|===

=== Å synes 

* Used to express an opinion based on experience or feeling. _(I’ve
experienced it and this is my feeling about it)._
* In English, this form of “think” can sometimes be replaced by “find.”

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*

|Jeg synes at Mads er en fantastisk skuespiller. a|
_I think Mads is a great actor._

_(I’ve seen him act and I feel he is good at it)._

|Bjørn synes at lingvistikk er interessant. |_Bjørn thinks (finds)
linguistics are interesting._

|Jeg synes at flere folk skal spille på Minecraft-serveren |_I think
more people should play on the minecraft server_
|===

=== Å mene

* Mener is similar to synes but with a strong conviction.
* Also used when you are “pretty sure” about something.
* You know something from memory or have some confidence in what you’re
saying though you may not know with a 100% certainty (whereas “tror”
would seem like more of a guess).

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*

|Person 1: Hvor mange mennesker bor i Norge? +
Person 2: Jeg mener det er litt over 5 millioner. a|
_Person 1: How many people live in Norway?_

_Person 2: I think there are a little over 5 million._

|Jeg mener at filmen vant en Oscar. |_I think (am pretty sure) that the
film won an Oscar._
|===

*Practice: Tenker, tror, eller synes*

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

|*1* |Jeg synes ikke at ananas er bra på pizza. |_I don’t think that
pineapple is good on pizza._

|*2* |Sofia tenker på livet sitt. |_She thinks about her life._

|*3* |Tenk over hva du er takknemlig for. |_Think about what you are
thankful for._

|*4* |Christian tror at filmen begynner kl. 8. |_Christian thinks that
the film starts at 8._

|*5* |Hva synes du om anime? |_What do you think about anime?_
|===

== To Know

“To know” is another one of those verbs in English that we use in
multiple ways. In Norwegian, however, there are different ways to
express “to know” depending on the circumstances.

=== Å kjenne

* Used when you want to express that you know someone or you are
acquainted with someone or something.
* It can also be used to express that one knows an area or place very
well.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*

|Kjenner du Lars? |_Do you know Lars?_

|Faren min kjenner Markus fra jobb(en) sin. |_My father knows Markus
from his job._

|Victor kjenner den boken av Stephen King. |_Victor knows of (is
familiar with) that book by Stephen King._

|Lea kjenner byen godt fordi hun vokste opp der. |_Lea knows the city
well because she grew up there._

|Han kjenner henne fra skole. |_He knows her from school._
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* In English, we have the idiom “To know someplace
like the back of your hand.” In Norwegian, there is a similar idiom: “Å
kjenne noe som sin egen bukselomme”

=== Å vite

* Used when one is referring to facts, specifics, or superficial
knowledge or wisdom of something__.__

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*
|Vet du når flyet kommer? |_Do you know when the plane arrives?_
|Jeg vet ikke når filmen starter. |_I don’t know when the film starts._
|Vet du om vi har fri i dag? |_Do you know if we have off today?_
|Vet du om vi har noen epler? |_Do you know if we have any apples?_
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* The only direct objects that “å vite” can take
are: Det, dette, noe, ingenting, alt, ting.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*
|Maja vet alt. |_Maja knows everything._
|Tobias vet ingenting. |_Tobias knows nothing._
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE 2:#* “Å kjenne” is never used with hv- words; for
sentences with hv- words, “å vite” is used.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*

|Politiet vet hvem som stjal lommeboken. |_The police know who stole the
wallet._

|Gutten vet hva som er i boksen. |_The boy knows what’s in the box._

|Vet du hvor mobiltelefonen min er? |_Do you know where my cell phone
is?_

|Jeg vet ikke hvorfor vi er her. |_I don’t know why we are here._

|Onkelen min vet hvordan man kjører en motorsykkel. |_My uncle knows how
to drive a motorcycle._
|===

=== Å kunne

* Used when one wants to express that they know how to speak a language.
* Also used if someone knows how to do a certain skill.
* Also used when one knows something by heart; it refers to more
thorough, in-depth knowledge of something.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*
|Emilie kan (snakke) norsk. |_Emilie can speak Norwegian._
|Han kan bussruten. |_He knows the bus route (by heart)._
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* The verb for “to remember” is “å huske” and “to
memorize” is “å lære seg utenat” or “å pugge.”

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Verb* |*Example* |*English*

|*Å kunne* |Faren min kan tidsplanen (utenat). |_My father knows the
schedule (by heart)._

|*Å huske* |Faren min husket tidsplanen. |_My father remembered the

|*Å lære seg utenat / Å pugge* a|
