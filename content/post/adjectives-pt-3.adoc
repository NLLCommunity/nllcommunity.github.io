== Similarity & Dissimilarity

In a previous lesson we learned how to compare things using the -ere /
-est(e) endings or using “mer” and “mest.” In Norwegian, we can also
compare similarity and dissimilarity between things.

*_Expressing similarity_*

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Norwegian* |*English*

a|
*Like + adj:*

equally

|Barna er like smarte. |_The children are equally smart._

a|
*Like + adj + som:*

as…as

|Hun var like vennlig som hun var vakker. |_She was as friendly as she
was beautiful._

a|
*Samme + noun + som:*

the same…as

|De snakker samme dialekt som oss. |_They speak the same dialect as us._

a|
*Ligne*:

Be / look like

|Han ligner på faren sin. |_He is / looks like his dad._
|===

*_Expressing dissimilarity_*

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Norwegian* |*English*

a|
*Forskjellige:*

Used in reference to a mutual difference

|Disse skoene er forskjellige. |_These shoes are different._

a|
*Annerledes:*

Used when referring to something that is different from something else.

|Støvlene er annerledes enn skoene. |_The boots are different than the
shoes._

a|
*Annen / Annet / Andre:*

Other; different

|Kan du gå i noe annet enn sandaler? |_Can you wear something different
/ other than sandals?_
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* "Annerledes" can also be used as an adverb.

Ex: Hvis det ikke virker, må vi gjøre det annerledes.

If it doesn't work, then we must do it differently.

*[.underline]#NOTE 2:# Annen, Annet, Andre* +
Whether one uses “annen” or “annet” depends on the indefinite noun being
described. “Andre” is used for definite nouns and plural nouns.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Norwegian* |*English*

|*Annen* |Tobias kjørte en annen bil. |_Tobias drove another / a
different car._

|*Annet* |Faren min bor i et annet hus. |_My father lives in another / a
different house._

.4+|*Andre* |Han kjørte den andre veien. |_He drove the other way._

|Onkelen min bor i det andre huset. |_My uncle lives in the other
house._

|De andre bilene er dyre. |_The other cars are expensive._

|Det er andre hus til salgs. |_There are other houses for sale._
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* The use of annen / andre in the following examples
means “second.”

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Norwegian* |*English*
|Den annen / andre mai |The second of May
|Dronning Elizabeth den annen / andre |Queen Elizabeth the second
|Jeg går i annen / andre klasse. |I am in the second year of school.
|Jeg bor i annen / andre etasje. |I live on the second floor
|===

*Notice* in those examples above, annen and andre can both be used to
mean “second.” However, keep in mind the following:

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Norwegian* |*English*
|Den andre dagen. |The second day. +
(Or “the other day” but not referring a recent event).
|Forleden dag |The other day. (Only in reference to a recent event).
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* Ambiguities can arise because “det / den andre”
can mean both “the other” and “the second.”

Ex: De bor i det andre huset.

This can mean *_both_*:

[arabic]
. They live in the other house.
. They live in the second house.

Context, stress, intonation pattern can all help distinguish the
difference in these sort of sentences.

== Countables & Uncountables

In a previous lesson, we talked a bit about mere vs flere. There are
other quantifiers in Norwegian that are used for items that can be
counted and things that cannot be counted.

Let’s look at quantifiers for *countable* items.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Quantifier* |*English* |*Eksempel* |*English*
|*Mange* |Many; a lot of |Jeg har mange bøker. |_I have many books._
|*Noen* |Some |Jeg har noen bøker. |_I have some books._
|*Få* |Few |Jeg har få bøker. |_I have a few books._
|*Flere* |Several |Jeg har flere bøker. |_I have several books._
|*Ingen* |No; none |Jeg har ingen bøker. |_I have no books._
|===

Here are quantifiers for *uncountable* items.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Quantifier* |*English* |*Eksempel* |*English*
|*Mye* |A lot of; much |Jeg har mye sukker. |_I have a lot of sugar._
|*Noe* |Some |Jeg har noe sukker. |_I have some sugar._
|*Litt* |A little |Jeg har litt sukker. |_I have a little sugar._
|*Ikke noe* |No; none |Jeg har ikke noe sukker. |_I have no sugar._
|*Mer(e)* |More |Jeg har mer(e) sukker. |_I have more sugar._
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* If you want to say someone has a lot of money (as
in the total amount they have), you would say “mye penger.” However, if
you mean they have a lot of coins or bills (physically), you’d use
“mange penger.”

Some quantifiers have to agree in number and / or gender with the noun
that it is connected to.

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
2.+|*Singular* .2+|*Plural* .2+|*English* 
.2+| *Eksempel* .2+|*English*

|*Masc. / Fem.* |*Neut.*

.3+|*All* .3+|*Alt* .3+|*Alle* .3+|All; everything |Du har all makten. |_You have
all the power._

|Har du alt smøret? |_Do you have all of the butter?_

|Jeg har alle filmene. |_I have all the films._

.2+|*Enhver* .2+|*Ethvert* .2+|+______+ .2+|Each; every; everyone |Enhver person er
annerledes. |_Each person is different._

|Ethvert forsøk på matlaging har feilet. |_Every attempt at
cooking has failed._

.2+|*Hver* .2+|*Hvert* .2+|+______+ .2+|Each |Hver elev leste boken. |_Each student
read the book._

|Hvert hus hadde et basseng. |_Each house had a pool._
|===

== Adjectival Nouns

Adjectival nouns are adjectives that are used like a noun. There are 3
cases in which adjectives can be used as nouns in Norwegian.

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Usage* |*Norwegian* |*English*

|When the noun is omitted to avoid repetitiveness. |Jeg foretrekker
norske nyheter i stedet for amerikanske (nyheter). |_I prefer Norwegian
news instead of American (news)._

|When the noun is understood when it is not mentioned. |De unge forstår
ikke de gamle. |_The young (people) don’t understand the old (people)._

|Independent use of the adjective with no noun understood. |Valget var
mellom rødt og blått. |_The choice was between red and blue._
|===

Norwegian uses adjectival nouns in the definite plural the same way that
English does.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Norwegian* |*English*

|De fattige trenger hjelp. |_The poor (people) need help._

|De arbeidsløse trenger mer støtte. |_The unemployed (people) need more
support._

|De syke håper på en kur. |_The sick (people) are hoping for a cure._

|De sårede ble evakuert. |_The wounded (people) were evacuated._
|===

Norwegian also uses definite adjectival nouns in the singular form.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Norwegian* |*English*
|Den uskyldige ble arresteret. |_The innocent (person) was arrested._
|Den anklagede sto for retten. |_The accused (person) stood trial._
|===

Plural indefinite adjectival nouns are used only for people.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Norwegian* |*English*

|Det var reisende fra overalt. |_There were travellers from everywhere._

|Katten mjauet mens forbipasserende gikk forbi. |_The cat meowed as
passers-by walked past._
