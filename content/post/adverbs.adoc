Adverbs are used to modify adjectives, verbs, clauses and other adverbs. This lesson explains the many uses of adverbs and how to use them in sentences.

== *[.underline]#Grammar Review#*

=== *Sentence structure* 

While most Norwegian sentences use the subject-verb-object (SVO) word
order, like English does, Norwegian does have the V2 (verb second) rule.
If an adverbial phrase or subordinate clause is at the front of the
sentence, the subject and the verb have to switch places (this is called
“inversion”) so that the verb stays in the second position.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.2+|*SVO* |Markus besøkte moren sin i går. |_Markus visited his mother
yesterday._

|Nora hadde på seg en genser siden det var kaldt. |_Nora wore a
sweater since it was cold._

.2+|*V2* |I går besøkte Markus moren sin. |_Yesterday, Markus visited his
mother._

|Siden det var kaldt, hadde Nora på seg en genser. |_Since it was
cold, Nora wore a sweater._
|===

If a sentence has more than one verb, the second verb will be in a
nonfinite form (e.g. å finne). If the sentence has inversion, then the
subject will come between the finite (i.e. conjugated) verb and the
nonfinite verb.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.2+|*SVO* |Oliver begynte å jobbe i en ny jobb i går. |_Oliver began
working at a new job yesterday._

|Ella prøvde å lære spansk siden kjæresten hennes var fra Spania.
|_Ella tried to learn Spanish since her boyfriend was from Spain._

.2+|*V2* |I går begynte Oliver å jobbe på en ny jobb. |_Yesterday, Oliver
began working at a new job._

|Siden Ellas kjæreste var fra Spania, prøvde hun å lære spansk.
|_Since Ella’s boyfriend is from Spain, she tried to learn Spanish._
|===

=== *Verb Conjugation*

Conjugating present tense of verbs in Norwegian is fairly simple. Most
present tense verbs just add an -r to the end of the infinitive.

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*

|Å tegne |Tegner |_Draws / Drawing_ |Å spille |Spiller |_Plays /
Playing_

|Å besøke |Besøker |_Visits / Visiting_ |Å snakke |Snakker |_Talks /
Talking_
|===

There are some exceptions / irregulars:

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*
|Å kunne |Kan |To be able to |Å måtte |Må |To have to
|Å skulle |Skal |To have to; to be going to |Å ville |Vil |To want
|Å være |Er |_To be_ |Å vite |Vet |_To know_
|===

Past tense conjugation is a bit more difficult, however there are some
guidelines (but keep in mind there are exceptions).

[arabic]
. If the verb ends with a double consonant, consonant cluster, or voiced
plosive (b / d), past tense will end in -et.
. If the verb ends in a single consonant (except v / b / d), past tense
ends in -te.
. If the verb ends with v or diphthong, the past tense ends in -de.
. If the verb has only one syllable with a long vowel, past tense ends
in -dde.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Rule Number* |*Infinitive* |*Past Tense* |*English*
.2+|*1* |Å sna[.underline]##kk##e |Snakket |_Talked_
|Å ø[.underline]##nsk##e |Ønsket |_Wished_
.2+|*2* |Å læ[.underline]##r##e |Lærte |_Learned_
|Å kjø[.underline]##p##e |Kjøpte |_Bought_
.2+|*3* |Å le[.underline]##v##e |Levde |_Lived_
|Å pl[.underline]##ei##e |Pleide |_Used_
|*4* |Å b[.underline]##o## |Bodde |_Lived_
|===

For future tense, typically the present tense verb is used with a time
adverbial to clarify it is a future action. (*[.underline]#Note#*: There
are ways to form future sentences using modals; that is covered in a
more in-depth lesson).

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Eksempel* |*English*
|Sofie kjører til Oslo i morgen. |_Sofie is driving to Oslo tomorrow._
|Filmen kommer ut neste uke. |_The film comes out next week._
|===

=== *Adjective Basics*

Adjectives typically have to agree with the gender and the number of the
noun.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| 2.+|*Singular Indefinite* 2.+|*Plural Indefinite*

| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*

.2+|*Masculine* |En rød genser |_A red sweater_ |Røde gensere |_Red
sweaters_

|En svart ravn |_A black raven_ |Svarte ravner |_Black ravens_

.2+|*Feminine* |Ei rød vogn |_A red wagon_ |Røde vogner |_Red wagons_

|Ei svart kråke |_A black crow_ |Svarte kråker |_Black crows_

.2+|*Neuter* |Et rødt skjerf |_A red scarf_ |Røde skjerf |_Red scarves_

|Et svart ekorn |_A black squirrel_ |Svarte ekorn |_Black squirrels_
|===

When the noun is in the definite form, the adjective takes an -e ending
(like in the plural indefinite above).

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| 2.+|*Singular Definite* 2.+|*Plural Definite*

| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*

.2+|*Masculine* |Den røde genseren |_The red sweater_ |De røde genserne
|_The red sweaters_

|Denne svarte ravnen |_This black raven_ |Disse svarte ravnene |_These
black ravens_

.2+|*Feminine* |Den røde vogna |_The red wagon_ |De røde vognene |_The red
wagons_

|Denne svarte kråka |_This black crow_ |Disse svarte kråkene |_These
black crows_

.2+|*Neuter* |Det røde skjerfet |_The red scarf_ |De røde skjerfa |_The red
scarves_

|Dette svarte ekornet |_This black squirrel_ |Disse svarte ekornene
|_These black squirrels_

== *[.underline]#Adverbs#*

Adverbs are used to either modify, amplify, or diminish. +
 +
*Modify*

They can be used to modify either a verb, adjective, a clause, or
another adverb.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
|*What it modifies* |*Example sentence* |*Adverb* |*What it is
modifying* |*English*

|*Verb* |Faren min løper fort. |fort |løper |_My father runs fast._

|*Adjective* |Emilie er ekstremt smart. |ekstremt |smart |_Emilie is
extremely smart._

|*A clause* |Filip arbeider ofte sent. |ofte |arbeider sent |_Filip
often works late._

|*Adverb* |Hun løper utrolig fort. |utrolig |fort |_She runs incredibly
fast._
|===

*Amplify*

Adverbs that amplify, strengthen the meaning of an adjective or another
adverb. Many adverbs that are derived from adjectives act as amplifiers.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
|*Adverb* |*English* |*Example sentence* |*What it is amplifying*
|*English*

|Helt |Entirely, completely |Koppen er helt full. |full |_The cup is
entirely full_

|Mye |Very; much |Maja tegner mye bedre enn meg. |bedre |_Maja draws
much better than me._

|Altfor |Far too |Jeg har bodd her altfor lenge. |lenge |_I have lived
here for far too long._

|Fryktelig |Dreadfully; terribly |Det var en fryktelig kjedelig film.
|kjedelig |_It was a dreadfully boring film._
|===

*Diminish*

Adverbs that diminish, lessen or weaken the meaning of an adjective or
another adverb.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
|*Adverb* |*English* |*Example sentence* |*What it is diminishing*
|*English*

|Litt |A little |Kan du snakke litt tregere? |tregere |_Can you speak a
little slower?_

|Nok |Enough |Har du nok mat å spise? |mat |_Do you have enough food to
eat?_

|Nesten |Almost |Han vant nesten konkurransen. |vant |_He almost won the
competition._
|===

Adverbs describe how often the action (being described) occurred and the
speaker’s attitude about what is being said.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
| |*Example* |*Adverb* |*English*
|*Manner* |Tor løper fort. |fort |_Tor runs fast._
|*Time* |Tor løper ofte. |ofte |_Tor runs often._
|*Place* |Tor løper ute. |ute |_Tor runs outside._
|*Degree* |Tor løper svært fort. |svært |_Tor runs very fast._
|===

Sentence adverbs express a condition that is related to the entire
sentence.

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Example* |*Adverb* |*English*

|Jeg skal ikke lese i dag. |ikke |_I will not read today_

|Jeg skal kanskje lese i dag. |kanskje |_I will maybe read today._

|Jeg må dessverre lese i dag. |dessverre |_I have to read today,
unfortunately._

|Jeg vil gjerne lese i dag. |gjerne |_I would like to read today._

|Jeg skal sannsynligvis lese i dag. |sannsynligvis |_I probably will
read today._
|===

=== *Types of Adverbs*

There are two major types of adverbs: Simple adverbs and adverbs that
are derived from other words.

*Simple Adverbs:*

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Adverb* |*English* |*Adverb* |*English*
|Alltid |_Always_ |Da |_When; then; as_
|Aldri |Never |Ellers |_Otherwise_
|Der |_There_ |Ikke |_Not_
|Her |_Here_ |Kanskje |_Perhaps_
|Bare |_Only_ |Litt |_A little; somewhat_
|Mye |_Very; much_ |Nok |_Enough; probably_
|Nesten |_Almost_ |Nå |_Now_
|Ofte |_Often_ |Akkurat |_Exactly_
|Sikkert |_Probably; surely_ |Egentlig |_Really_
|Også |_Also_ |Altså |_Therefore_
|Sannelig |_Certainly_ |Imidlertid |_However_
|Sjelden |_Rarely_ |Ennå |_Yet_
|Nettopp |_Just_ |Nylig |_Recently_
|Neppe |_Hardly_ |Nær |_Near; close_
|Slik |_So_ a|
Hvorledes

_(rarely used)_

|_In what way_
|===

*Adverbs derived from other words*

Many adverbs are derived from adjectives by adding a -t to the singular
form. In many cases, this means it is identical to the neuter gender
singular form of the adjective.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Example* |*English*

|*Adverb* .2+|Vakkert |Beautifully |Moren min synger vakkert. |_My mom
sings beautifully._

|*Adjective* |Beautiful |Språket er vakkert. |_The language is
beautiful._

|*Adverb* .2+|Godt |Well |Kattene leker godt sammen. |_The cats play well
together._

|*Adjective* |Well, good |Sønnen min er et godt barn. |_My son is a
good child._

|*Adverb* .2+|Høyt |Loudly |Hun skrek høyt. |_She screams loudly._

|*Adjective* |Loud |Hun ga et høyt skrik. |_She gave a loud shriek._

|*Adverb* .2+|Langt |Far |Vennen min bor langt unna. |_My friend lives far
away._

|*Adjective* |Long |Han hadde et langt tau. |_He had a long rope._
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* If an adjective does not take a -t ending in the
indefinite neuter gender singular form, then it will not take a -t
ending when it is used as an adverb.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*
|*Adjective* |Det er et billig leketøy. |_It is a cheap toy_
|*Adverb* |Produktet var billig laget. |_The product was cheaply made._
|===

Some adverbs can be used to make comparisons.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Basic* |*English* |*Comparison* |*Superlative*
|Fort |_Fast_ |Fortere |Fortest
|Pent |_Pretty_ |Penere |Penest
|Sakte |_Slow_ |Saktere |Saktest
|Ofte |_Often_ |Oftere |Oftest
|Stygt |_Ugly_ |Styggere |Styggest
|Sjeldent |_Rare_ |Sjeldnere |Sjeldnest
|Høyt |_High_ |Høyere |Høyest
|===

There are some adverbs that are irregular when making comparisons:

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Basic* |*English* |*Comparison* |*Superlative*
|Bra |_Good_ |Bedre |Best
|Dårlig |_Bad_ |Verre |Verst
|Mye |_Much_ |Mer |Mest
|Lite |_Little_ |Mindre |Minst
|===

=== *Location and Motion Towards*

Among those adverbs that denote place, there are some that have two
distinct but parallel forms:

* The base form (without -e): used to indicate motion (whether actual,
imagined, or implied) towards a place.
* The expanded form (with -e): used to indicate location, rest, or
movement within a location or area.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Motion Towards* |*English* |*Location* |*English*
|Inn |_Inside; in_ |Inne |_In; inside; indoors_
|Ut |_Out; outside_ |Ute |_Out; outside; outdoors_
|Opp |_Up; upstairs_ |Oppe |_Upstairs_
|Ned |_Down; downstairs_ |Nede |_Downstairs_
|Bort |_Away_ |Borte |_Away_
|Hjem |_Home(ward)_ |Hjemme |_(at) home_
|Frem |_Forward_ |Fremme |_At the destination_
|===

Let’s look at a couple of examples:

[cols=",,,",]
|===
| |*Example* |*Adverb* |*English*

.2+|*Motion towards* |Han vil gå hjem i morgen. |hjem |_He will go home
tomorrow._

|Han klatret opp i et tre. |opp |_He climbed up into a tree._

.2+|*Location* |Han er ikke hjemme i dag. |hjemme |_He is not home today._

|Fuglene sitter oppe i treet. |oppe |_The birds are sitting up in the
tree._
|===

=== *Adding Adverbs*

When adding adverbs to a sentence, such as “ikke,” word order becomes a
little more tricky.

If the adverb is in the main clause:

[arabic]
. *SVO* - The adverb is placed after the finite (i.e. conjugated) verb.
. *V2* - The adverb is placed after the subject.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*
|*SVO* |Jeg kjøpte *ikke* en frakk i dag. |_I did not buy a coat today._
|*V2* |I dag kjøpte jeg *ikke* en frakk. |_Today, I did not buy a coat._
|===

If the adverb is in the subordinate clause, the adverb comes before the
finite verb, regardless of whether there is inversion.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

|*SVO* |Jeg kjøpte en frakk, siden den *ikke* var dyr. |_I bought a coat
since it was not expensive._

|*V2* |Siden den *ikke* var dyr, kjøpte jeg frakken. |_Since it was not
expensive, I bought the coat._
|===

If the sentence contains a compound verb (i.e. har brukt; har besøkt,
etc),

[arabic]
. *SVO* - The adverb comes after the finite verb in the compound.
. *V2* - The subject comes after the finite verb of the compound,
followed by the adverb, then the second verb in the compound.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

|*SVO* |Jeg har *ikke* brukt den nye frakken min ennå. |_I have not used
my new coat yet._

|*V2* |Siden det var deilig ute, hadde jeg *ikke* tatt med meg frakken
min. |_Since it was nice outside, I had not brought my coat (with me)._
