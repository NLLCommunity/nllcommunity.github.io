== Norway’s Climate

Norway is a long country with different types of terrain features. The
southeast area of Norway has a lot of forests and hills. The west has
fjords, mountains, and glaciers; the middle of Norway has many glaciers,
and the north has fjords, mountains, and glaciers also. The Scandinavian
Mountain range stretches from the south to the north which has led to
the formation of many valleys throughout the country.

The weather can vary a lot depending on what part of the country you are
in. Due to the mild temperatures of the Gulf Stream waters, the coastal
areas of Norway tend to have a milder climate than other areas that are
at the same latitude, such as Alaska. Further inland and up north is
where the coldest temperatures (and snow) are found during the winter
months. The summers inland tend to be dry and hot.

=== Seasons

Spring (March - May) brings with it longer days, warmer weather
(typically), and flowers. Some places, particularly further north, may
still get snow. Elsewhere, melting snow can create waterfalls.

Summertime (June - August) brings warm (but not too hot) temperatures.
In some places, the sun does not even set; this phenomenon is referred
to as the midnight sun. It can be seen in places around (and above) the
Arctic Circle. In Svalbard, the midnight sun lasts from 20 April to 22
August. The Oslo area receives quite a bit of rainfall during the year
but August is the wettest month for the area. On average, the high
temperatures in Norway, during summer, are between high 60s to low 70s F
(20 to 22C). The peak tourist time for Norway is June - July.

Autumn (September - November) typically brings with it rain (and in some
places snow in November). Trees begin to change colors, creating a
beautiful patchwork of reds, oranges, and yellows. This is a great time
to go hiking, if one isn’t fond of the summer heat. October is one of
the cheapest months to visit Norway, because it isn’t quite ski season
yet, however many of the summer attractions are closed.

Winter (December - February) is the time for cold weather (frequently
below freezing) and snow...and lots of it, depending on where in Norway
one lives (or visits). This is a great time for those who enjoy skiing.
If you do like to ski, just be sure to follow the
https://www.visitnorway.com/plan-your-trip/safety-first/mountain-safety/the-mountain-code/[Norwegian mountain code] (fjellvettreglene), which consists of 9 rules, including
paying attention to weather and avalanche warnings; be prepared for bad
weather; choose safe routes, etc. During the winter, the days are short
and the nights are long. Areas north of the Arctic Circle may not see
the sun for weeks or even months. This is also a great time to see the

particularly in areas north of the Arctic Circle, around the coasts of
Tromsø. If one is not fond of cold weather, the Oslo area has some of
the warmest temperatures during the winter months.
