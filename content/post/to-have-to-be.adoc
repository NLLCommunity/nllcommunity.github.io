== Grammar Review

=== Sentence structure

While most Norwegian sentences use the subject-verb-object (SVO) word
order, like English does, Norwegian does have the V2 (verb second) rule.
If an adverbial phrase or subordinate clause is at the front of the
sentence, the subject and the verb have to switch places (this is called
“inversion”) so that the verb stays in the second position.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.2+|*SVO* |Ella konkurrerte i turneringen forrige uke. |_Ella competed in
the tournament last week._

|Markus besøkte museet da han var i D.C. |_Markus visited the museum
when he was in D.C._

.2+|*V2* |Forrige uke konkurrerte Ella i turneringen. |_Last week, Ella
competed in the tournament._

|Da Markus var i D.C., besøkte han museet. |_When Markus was in D.C.,
he visited the museum._
|===

If a sentence has more than one verb, the second verb will be in a
nonfinite form (e.g. å finne). If the sentence has inversion, then the
subject will come between the finite (i.e. conjugated) verb and the
nonfinite verb.

| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.2+|*SVO* |Christian prøvde å reparere bilen i går. |_Christian tried to
repair the car yesterday._

|Marie pleide å spille i et band da hun var i 20-årene. |_Marie used
to play in a band when she was in her 20s._

.2+|*V2* |I går prøvde Christian å reparere bilen |_Yesterday, Christian
tried to repair the car._

|Da Marie var i 20-årene, pleide hun å spille i et band. |_When Marie
was in her 20s, she used to play in a band._

=== Verb Conjugation

Conjugating the present tense of verbs in Norwegian is fairly simple.
Most present tense verbs just add an -r to the end of the infinitive.

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*

|Å stave |staver |_Spells / Spelling_ |Å fortsette |fortsetter
|_Continues / Continuing_

|Å kaste |kaster |_Throws / Throwing_ |Å støtte |støtter |_Supports /
Supporting_
|===

Past tense conjugation is a bit more difficult, however there are some
guidelines (but keep in mind there are exceptions).

[arabic]
. If the verb ends with a double consonant, consonant cluster, or voiced
plosive (b / d), past tense will end in -et.
. If the verb ends in a single consonant (except v / b / d), past tense
ends in -te.
. If the verb ends with v or diphthong, the past tense ends in -de.
. If the verb has only one syllable with a long vowel, past tense ends
in -dde.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Rule Number* |*Infinitive* |*Past Tense* |*English*
.2+|*1* |Å støtte |støttet |_Supported_
|Å stave |stavet |_Spelled_
.2+|*2* |Å bruke |Brukte |_Used_
|Å male |Malte |_Painted_
.2+|*3* |Å leve |levde |_Lived_
|Å greie |greide |_Managed_
.2+|*4* |Å kna |knadde |_Kneaded_
|Å spy |spydde |_Spewed_
|===

There are two ways to talk about future activities. Sometimes a present
tense verb + a time adverbial is used. Modal verbs are another way to
express future tense.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

|*Present Tense + Time Adverbial* |Moren min drar til butikken senere.
|_My mom is going to the shop later._

|*Modal Verbs* |Jens skal spille det nye dataspillet. |_Jens is going to
play the new computer game._
|===

== To Have

In English, we often say “have” to refer to things we are receiving or
obtaining, in addition to things that are already in our possession. For
example, “Can I have some cake?” The cake is not in our possession, and
“have” could be replaced with “receive.”

In Norwegian, these two concepts are separate.

===  Å ha 

Used for:

* Things that are (or were) in your possession
* Physical traits one has
* Experiences
* Also in the present perfect and past perfect (aka pluperfect) tenses;
in which case the verb following it is in the past participle form.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Eksempel* |*English*

|Marianne har en blå sykkel. |_Marianne has a blue bicycle._

|Lukas hadde en hund da han var ung. |_Lukas had a dog when he was
young._

|Sjefen har fregner. |_The boss has freckles._

|Gutten hadde en drøm om en drage. |_The boy had a dream about a
dragon._

|De har ventet i 20 minutter. |_They have waited for 20 minutes._

|Franklyn har grønne øyne. |_Franklyn has green eyes._
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* In English, we often use “to have to” to mean
“must.” In Norwegian, you cannot do this. In these cases, you’d use the
modal verb “å måtte” instead.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Eksempel* |*English*

|Han må arbeide. |_He has to work. (He must work)_

|Hun må lytte til læreren sin. |_She has to (must) listen to her
teacher._
|===

=== Å få

Usage:

* As an adjective, it means “few”
* As a verb, it means “to get,” “to receive,” “to obtain,” or “to have.”
* It can act as a modal auxiliary verb in some sentences.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.3+|*Regular Verb* |Erik får en ny sykkel til bursdagen sin. |_Erik is
getting a new bike for his birthday._

|Emma fikk boka fra vennen sin. |_Emma got the book from her friend._

|Eg har ikkje fått eit brev frå Skatteetaten. |_I have not gotten a
letter from Skatteetaten._

.3+|*Auxiliary Verb* |Det får vente. |_It has to wait._

|Gustav fikk se den nye filmen forrige helg. |_Gustav got to see the
new film last weekend._

|Kan jeg få være i fred? |_Can I get some peace (and quiet)?_

|Du får holde deg i karantene. |
|===

In the first set of examples, “å få” is conjugated like a normal verb
when followed by a noun. +
In the bottom set of examples, when “å få” is followed by another verb,
it’s treated as a modal auxiliary, and the second verb remains in the
infinitive without the infinitive (å) marker.

Sometimes å få can replace other auxiliary verbs (kan, skal, vil, etc).

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*
|Vi får se. |_We will see._
|Hun får et barn snart. |_She will have a child soon._
|===

Å få can also…

* Take on the meaning of “permission” or “to be allowed” to do
something.

*However*, if the verb following “få” is a past participle, then

* It takes on the meaning of “to achieve” or “to manage to do”
something.
* A past participle typically expresses that the past action was
completed.

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Meaning* |*Example* |*English*

.3+|*To be allowed* |Får jeg bruke mobiltelefonen din? |_May I use your
cell phone?_

|Du får låne boken min. |_You can borrow my book._

|Får jeg lov til å forlate huset |_Am i allowed to leave the house_

.4+|*To achieve* |Jeg fikk funnet nålen i høystakken. |_I managed to find
the needle in the haystack._

|Jeg fikk skrevet leksjonen i går. |_I managed to write the lesson
yesterday._

|Han fikk gått 100 km på ski i dag. |_He managed to ski 100 km today._

|Jeg får til alt jeg prøver på. |_I achieve everything I try to do._
|===

There are a few fixed expressions that use “å få.”

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Expresion* |*English* |*Example* |*English*

|Få tak i a|
To get hold of

*Practice: (Å ha eller å få)*

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Eksempel* |*English*
|Karine fekk kortet i posten. |_Karine got the card in the mail._
|Karine har kortet hengt opp. |_Karine has the card hanging up._
|Kan katten få godbiter? |_Can the cat have treats?_
|Katten har ei rød sløyfe. |_The cat has a red bowtie._
|===

== To Be
Å være refers to how something or someone is in a particular moment and is fixed in that moment, whereas å bli is used when there is change taking place. 

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Å bli* |*Å være*
|Continue to be |To be
|Begin to be |To exist
|Develop into |To stay, reside
|Prove to be |To remain
|===

Let’s look at a few examples of both verbs.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Example* |*English*

.3+|*Å være* |Sofie er 25 år gammel |_Sofie is 25 years old._

|Isak er brannmann. |_Isak is a fireman._

|Sofie og Isak er glade sammen. |_Sofie and Isak are happy together._

.3+|*Å bli* |Sofie blir 26 i dag. |_Sofie turns (becomes) 26 today._

|Isak ble president. |_Isak became president._

|Sofie og Isak ble glade da de så valpen. |_Sofie and Isak became
happy when they saw the puppy._
|===

Notice that in the first set of examples, the subjects are in that
particular moment. In the second set of sentences, the subjects are
changing (or have changed) in some manner.

Both verbs can be combined with auxiliary verbs

| |*Example* |*English*

.2+|*Å være* |Du [.underline]#burde# ha vært mer forsiktig. |_You should
have been more careful._

|Emil [.underline]#kan# være irriterende noen ganger. |_Emil can be

.2+|*Å bli* |Du [.underline]#kunne# ha blitt skadet. |_You could have been
(become) injured._

|Emil [.underline]#kan# bli frustrert noen ganger. |_Emil can become

|Servitøren ble flau etter at han sølte brus. |_The waiter became

|===

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* There are two other words that are used in
Norwegian that, in English, can be replaced with “to be.”

* Ligge - Refers to where something is geographically located.
* Koste - Refers to the cost of something.

|===
|*Eksempel* |*English*
|Sverige ligger øst for Norge. |_Sweden is (located) east of Norway._
|Boka koster 30 kroner. |_The book is (costs) 30 kroner._
