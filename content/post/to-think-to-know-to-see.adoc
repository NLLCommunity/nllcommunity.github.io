Some verbs in Norwegian have more than one word that can be used, but
when to use which word can be difficult. Three examples are “to think,”
“to know,” and “to see.”
<!--more-->

==  To Think

In English, “to think” is used in different ways, such as to ponder, to
give an opinion on something, and as another way to say “believe.”
Norwegian, however, has multiple words that are used in these
situations, and when to use them is kind of strict.

=== Å tenke 

* Used to mean to think; to ponder.
* It is referring to the mental process of thinking.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*

|Tenker du på meg ofte? |_Do you think of me often?_

|Tobias tenker på filosofi hver dag. |_Tobias thinks about philosophy
every day._
|===

=== Å tro 

* Used when one wants to express belief about something, however there
is some uncertainty.
* If, in English, you can replace “think” with “believe,” then this is
the word you need.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*

|Isabella tror at bursdagen hans er neste uke. |_Isabella thinks
(believe) his birthday is next week._

|Ella trodde at han ville være hjemme allerede. |_Ella thought
(believed) that he would be home already._
|===

=== Å synes 

* Used to express an opinion based on experience or feeling. _(I’ve
experienced it and this is my feeling about it)._
* In English, this form of “think” can sometimes be replaced by “find.”

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*

|Jeg synes at Mads er en fantastisk skuespiller. a|
_I think Mads is a great actor._

_(I’ve seen him act and I feel he is good at it)._

|Hun synes at det er interessant. |_She thinks (finds) it is
interesting._
|===

=== Å mene 

* Mener is similar to synes but with a strong conviction.
* Also used when you are “pretty sure” about something.
* You know something from memory or have some confidence in what you’re
saying though you may not know with a 100% certainty (whereas “tror”
would seem like more of a guess).

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*

|Person 1: Hvor mange mennesker bor i Norge? +
Person 2: Jeg mener det er litt over 5 millioner. a|
_Person 1: How many people live in Norway?_

_Person 2: I think there are a little over 5 million._

|Jeg mener at filmen vant en Oscar. |_I think (am pretty sure) that the
film won an Oscar._
|===

== To Know

“To know” is another one of those verbs in English that we use in
multiple ways. In Norwegian, however, there are different ways to
express “to know” depending on the circumstances.

=== Å kjenne

* Used when you want to express that you know someone or you are
acquainted with someone or something.
* It can also be used to express that one knows an area or place very
well.

[cols=",",]

|*Example* |*English*

|Kjenner du Markus? |_Do you know Markus?_

|Jeg kjenner Markus fra jobb(en). |_I know Markus from work._

|Victor kjenner boken. |_Victor knows of (is familiar with) the book._

|Lea kjenner byen godt fordi hun vokste opp der. |_Lea knows the city
well because she grew up there._
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE 1:#* In English, we have the idiom “To know someplace
like the back of your hand.” In Norwegian, there is a similar idiom: “Å
kjenne noe som sin egen bukselomme”

*[.underline]#NOTE 2:#* “Å kjenne” is never used with hv- words.

Ex: Jeg kjenner hvor byen er. - *[.underline]#WRONG!#*

Jeg vet hvor byen er. - *[.underline]#CORRECT.#*

I know where the city is.

=== Å vite

* Used when one is referring to facts, specifics, or superficial
knowledge or wisdom of somethi__ng.__

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*
|Vet du når bussen går? |_Do you know when the bus goes?_
|Jeg vet ikke når filmen starter. |_I don’t know when the film starts._
|Vet du om vi har fri i dag? |_Do you know if we have off today?_
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* The only direct objects that “å vite” can take
are: Det, dette, noe, ingenting, alt, ting. +
Ex: Maja vet alt. Tobias vet ingenting.

Maja knows everything. Tobias knows nothing.

=== Å kunne

* Used when one wants to express that they know how to speak a language.
* Also used if someone knows how to do a certain skill.
* Also used when one knows something by heart; it refers to more
thorough, in-depth knowledge of something.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*
|Emilie kan (snakke) norsk. |_Emilie can speak Norwegian._
|Han kan bussruten. |_He knows the bus route (by heart)._
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* The verb for “to remember” is “å huske” and “to
memorize” is “å lære seg utenat” or “å pugge.”

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Verb* |*Example* |*English*

|*Å kunne* |Faren min kan tidsplanen (utenat). |_My father knows the
schedule (by heart)._

|*Å huske* |Faren min husket tidsplanen. |_My father remembered the
schedule._

|*Å lære seg utenat / Å pugge* a|
Faren min lærte seg tidsplanen utenat.

Faren min pugget tidsplanen.

|_My father memorized the schedule._
|===

== To See

The verbs for “to see” in Norwegian can be used kind of interchangeably
but not always.

=== Å se

* Used when one is specifically referring to visually observing
something.
* It is not usually used to refer to meeting with someone__.__

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*
|Kan du se den røde bygningen? |_Can you see the red building?_
|Han ser en hund i vinduet. |_He sees a dog in the window._
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* “Å se” refers to the passive process of just
“seeing” whereas “å se på” refers to the more active process of looking
at something or watching something.

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Verb* |*Example* |*English*

|*Å se* |Hun så bildet i boken. |_She saw the picture in the book._

|*Å se på* |Hun så på bildet i boken. |_She looked at the picture in the
book._
|===

=== Å møte _eller_ å treffe

* Both “å møte” and “å treffe” refer to seeing someone, often by chance
but not aways.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*

|Jeg møtte Sofia på butikken i dag. |_I met (saw) Sofia at the store
today._

|Han traff henne på biblioteket. |_He met (saw) Emma at the library._
|===

=== Å snakke med

* Used when referring to seeing someone and talking with the person. It
emphasizes that there was a conversation that took place.
* Also used to refer to phone conversations.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Example* |*English*

manager._

|Lukas snakket med Mathias på telefonen. |_Lukas spoke with Mathias on
the telephone._
