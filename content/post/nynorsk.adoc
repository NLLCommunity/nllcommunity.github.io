Often, new learners of Norwegian will inevitably ask if someone speaks
bokmål or nynorsk, to which they get informed that bokmål and nynorsk
are not spoken languages but rather written standards. Instead,
Norwegians speak their local dialect (or sometimes a mix of dialects, if
they have moved around). Some dialects are closer to bokmål and some are
closer to nynorsk. But how does one language end up with two written
standards?

== History

As many may know, Norway was a part of Denmark for centuries. During
this time, the Norwegian language was heavily influenced by the Danish
language. In the cities, some would speak Danish with a Norwegian
intonation; this is called Dano-Norwegian (dansk-norsk). Danish was also
used as the writing system in Norway during this time period.

In 1814, however, Norway gained its independence from Denmark and Danish
lost its popularity among Norwegians. Questions arose as to what to do
with the written language. There were three options:

[arabic]
. Keep Danish as the written standard
. Create a written standard based on the dialects
. Norwegianify the Danish

A linguist named Ivar Aasen went to work creating a written standard
based on dialects. He did extensive research between 1842-1846,
travelling throughout parts of Norway, gathering information about the
rural dialects in the areas. He believed that the Norwegian spoken in
the rural areas, where the majority of the population was located, was
closer to original Norwegian than that of those who lived in the cities
and who were influenced heavily by Danish. It was Aasen’s belief that
the dialects shared a common structure that differentiated it from the
Danish and Swedish languages. In 1848, he published a comparative
dialect grammar book, followed by a dictionary in 1850. In 1853, he
published yet another book in which he described a written standard,
based on the common structures he found among the dialects, which he
called landsmål. He then continued to publish stories, poems, essays,
etc using this standard.

Meanwhile, there was another group of people that wanted to take Danish
and alter it to fit spoken Norwegian, instead. One particular linguist
named Knud Knudsen did just that, creating what he would call “riksmål.”

So now there were two forms of written Norwegian and there was no
agreement on which one to use. In 1885, the parliament declared that
“landsmål” and “riksmål” would both be official.

In 1907, a spelling reform took place (there would be many other
spelling reforms in following years, which I will not go into detail
about in this lesson). During this, the most common spoken aspects of
Norwegian were added to riksmål. Also, some of the more archaic aspects
in landsmål were abolished and a few small changes were introduced.
Eventually, the goal was to decrease the differences between landsmål
and riksmål, until there was only one written standard, samnorsk (Common
Norwegian). This goal was later abandoned in the 1960s.

Due to the spelling reforms, landsmål eventually became nynorsk and
riksmål eventually became bokmål, both of which were meant to be
“intermediary stages” to becoming “samnorsk.” This led to landsmål and
riksmål losing their status as “official standards” in 1929, as they
were replaced with nynorsk and bokmål.

== Norwegian Today

Approximately 85-90% of Norwegians today use bokmål as their written
standard. Nynorsk, on the other hand, is used by about 10-15% of the
population, mostly in western and central areas of southern Norway. In
Norway, each county and municipality can decide to declare either bokmål
or nynorsk as their standard or choose to be standard-neutral. As of
2015, only 26% of the municipalities declared nynorsk as their official
language, compared to 36% that declared bokmål as their official
language and the other 36% that remained neutral.

Technically, in schools, the standard that students are taught as their
primary language should be decided by referendum in each school
district. However, a student can demand to have nynorsk books even if
the overall primary is bokmål (with the exception of Norwegian class).
If there are more than 10 students that use nynorsk, they can demand to
be put into a separate group where everything is in nynorsk. As of 2016,
only 12.2% of elementary school students are taught nynorsk as their
primary written language. If a student’s primary written standard is
nynorsk, they are required to still learn bokmål and vice versa.

There are laws in place that enforce the use of nynorsk in media and
other areas. For example, NRK is required to have at least 25% of their
content in nynorsk. Most of the major newspapers also contain articles
in nynorsk. Many computer programs and apps that serve Norway have an
option to choose between bokmål and nynorsk. Some commercial products,
particularly if they are produced in majority-nynorsk areas, will
contain text in nynorsk. Universities are required to offer content in
nynorsk and to allow students to take exams in nynorsk if that is their
primary written language.

== Differences: Bokmål vs Nynorsk

This section is not an exhaustive list of the differences between bokmål
and nynorsk.

First, let us look at an example sentence in Danish, bokmål, and nynorsk
(since Danish heavily influenced bokmål).

Danish: Vi har syv ravne, en krage og flere vipstjerter.

Bokmål: Vi har syv / sju ravner, en / ei kråke og flere linerler.

Nynorsk: Vi / Me har sju ramnar, ei kråke og fleire linerler.

English: We have seven ravens, a crow, and several wagtails.

As you can see, in bokmål, one can use the Danish “syv” or the nynorsk
“sju” and either the masculine or feminine articles, “en” or “ei” for
kråke, whereas in Danish you can only use “en” and in nynorsk, you can
only use “ei.” Nynorsk does not offer these options. In nynorsk, you can
either say “Vi” or “Me” for “We”.

=== Nouns

In bokmål, there are three genders however the feminine gender is
optional. In nynorsk, this is not the case.

[cols=",,,,,",]

2.+|*[.underline]#Nynorsk#* 2.+|*[.underline]#Bokmål#*
2.+|*[.underline]#English#*

|*Indefinite* |*Definite* |*Indefinite* |*Definite* |*Indefinite*

.2+|Ei sol .2+|Sola |Ei sol |Sola .2+|_A sun_ .2+|_The sun_

|En sol |Solen

.2+|Ei hytte .2+|Hytta |Ei hytte |Hytta .2+|_A cabin_ .2+|_The cabin_

|En hytte |Hytten
|===

The articles for the masculine and neuter genders are also a bit
different in nynorsk.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
| |*Nynorsk* |*Bokmål* |*English*
|*Masculine* |Ein katt |En katt |_A cat_
|*Neuter* |Eit hus |Et hus |_A house_
|===

*[.underline]#Note:#* In the definite form, the masculine and neuter
forms in nynorsk are identical to the bokmål.

Ex: Ein katt Katten

A cat The cat

Eit hus Huset

A house The house

Plural endings in nynorsk, for masculine gender nouns, are different
than in bokmål.

|Katt**ene** |Cats

|*Neuter* |Eit hus |Hus |Husa |Et hus |Hus |Husene / Husa |Houses

=== Pronouns

There are some differences in pronouns between nynorsk and bokmål.

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Nynorsk* |*Bokmål* |*English* |*Nynorsk* |*Bokmål* |*English*
|Eg |Jeg |I |Meg |Meg |Me
|Du |Du |You |Deg |Deg |You
|Han |Han |He |Han |Ham |Him
|Ho |Hun |She |Henne / Ho |Henne |Her
|Det |Den / Det |It |Det |Den / Det |It
|Vi / Me |Vi |We |Oss |Oss |Us
|De / Dokker |Dere |You (plural) |Dykk / Dokker |Dere |You (plural)
|Dei |De |They |Dei |Dem |Them
|===

Unlike with bokmål, in nynorsk, the word “it” is dependent on the
grammatical gender of the noun that “it” is referring to.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
| |*Nynorsk* |*Bokmål* |*English*

|*Feminine* |Kor er boka mi? Ho er her |Hvor er boka mi? Den er her
|Where is my book? It is here

|*Masculine* |Kor er bilen min? Han er her |Hvor er bilen min? Den er
her |Where is my car? It is here

|*Neuter* |Kor er brevet mitt? Det er her |Hvor er brevet mitt? Det er
her |Where is my letter? It is here
|===

There are many other differences between nynorsk and bokmål, such as how
some verbs are conjugated; how some adjectives are formed to make
comparisons; the use of “j” in nynorsk (much more frequent than in
bokmål, for example ikkje vs ikke); the use of double consonants (much
more frequent in bokmål than in nynorsk, for example ven vs venn); some
determiners (i.e. that, this, those, these) are different; not to
mention there are some different vocabulary words as well. This lesson
was just to help explain why there are two written standards and to
illustrate just some of the differences. While the majority do use
bokmål for their written standard, nynorsk is just as valid of an option
for Norwegian speakers and learners.
