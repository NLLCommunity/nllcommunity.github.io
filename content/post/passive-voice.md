Active and passive sentences are syntactically related.

-   An active sentence tells who or what did something.

> Ex: Markus vasker bilen.
>
> Markus washes the car.

-   A passive sentence tells us what happened and to who / what.

> Ex: Bilen vaskes av Markus.
>
> The car is washed by Markus.
<!--more-->

In the above examples, the active sentence tells us who is washing the
car: Markus. Meanwhile, the passive sentence tells us what is being
washed: the car. Basically, when using passive voice, one is emphasizing
the object of an action or the result of an action instead of who is
doing the action.

Typically, when an active sentence is turned into the equivalent passive
sentence, three things happen:

1.  The object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive
    > sentence.

2.  The subject of the active sentence becomes a prepositional
    > complement in the passive sentence.

3.  The verb changes from an active to a passive form.

| **Active** | **Subject** | **Active Verb** | **Object** | **English**                           |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|---------------------------------------|
|            | Løven       | jager / jaget   | sebraen.   | *The lion chases / chased the zebra.* |
|            | Lukas       | spiser / spiste | kaken.     | *Lukas is eating / ate the cake.*     |

| **Passive** | **Subject** | **Passive Verb**   | **Preposition Complement** | **English**                                    |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|             | Sebraen     | jages / ble jaget  | av løven.                  | *The zebra is being / was chased by the lion.* |
|             | Kaken       | spises / ble spist | av Lukas.                  | *The cake is being / was eaten by Lukas.*      |

There are two types of passive construction in Norwegian:

**-s passive:** Dørene lukkes kl. 7. The doors will close at 7.

**Å bli passive:** Dørene ble lukket nå. The doors were closed now.

There’s also a third construction which is not technically “passive
voice,” however it’s still listed in some grammar books.

**Være passive:** Dørene er lukket nå. The doors are closed now.

**<span class="underline">The -s passive</span>**

The -s passive is formed by adding an -s to the end of the infinitive
verb. It is more limited in its usage.

1.  It is often used with instructions, recipes, news headlines, and
    > legal documents.

2.  It is often used in conjunction with modal verbs (i.e. kan, må, etc)
    > which express permission, obligation, prohibition, volition, etc.

3.  It can can also be used to express repeated or habitual actions and
    > with verbs expressing possession, and opinion.

**<span class="underline">Note:</span>** Some verbs can only form the
passive using -s, for example eie (own), vite (know).

**<span class="underline">The bli passive</span>**

This passive form is created by using a form of bli + past participle.
This is the most commonly used form of passive voice. (For information
on past participles, check this [<span
class="underline">lesson</span>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQM4okKpZAeT6o-pmgIhcof2GEw_f5BA5if58oqFE_4/edit?usp=sharing).)

1.  The present tense “blir” can be used when referring to a future
    > activity or event.

2.  The infinitive “bli” is generally used after modal verbs that
    > express possibility, logical necessity, and future promises.

3.  The bli passive is used for past tense and composite tenses.

**<span class="underline">The være passive</span>**

As mentioned, previously, while this is “technically” not a passive
form, it is listed with other passive forms in the grammar book, so I am
including it in this lesson. The være “passive” is formed by using være
+ past participle.

1.  When the participle is a verb - this construction usually describes
    > the result of a completed action; it emphasizes the state of
    > something instead of the action that brought it about.

2.  When the participle is an adjective - when the action is vague or
    > absent, the participle may take on the function of an adjective;
    > it remains in the -t form in both the singular and plural,
    > regardless of the noun’s gender.

| **Usage**                  | **Example**           | **English**               |

| Participle as a verb       | Boken er oversatt.    | *The book is translated.* |
|                            | Måltidet er laget.    | *The meal is cooked.*     |
|                            | Hunden er vasket.     | *The dog is washed.*      |
| Participle as an adjective | Jenta er forelsket.   | *The girl is in love*     |
|                            | Jentene er forelsket. | *The girls are in love.*  |
|                            | Døren er stengt.      | *The door is closed.*     |
|                            | Husene er solgt.      | *The houses are sold.*    |
