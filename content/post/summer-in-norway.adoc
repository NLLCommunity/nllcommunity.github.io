## Grammar Review

### Sentence structure

While most Norwegian sentences use the subject-verb-object (SVO) word
order, like English does, Norwegian does have the V2 (verb second) rule.
If an adverbial phrase or subordinate clause is at the front of the
sentence, the subject and the verb have to switch places (this is called
“inversion”) so that the verb stays in the second position.

| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.2+|*SVO* |Markus jobbet i hagen i går. |_Markus worked in the garden
yesterday._

|Sofia svømte i havet da hun var ung. |_Sofia swam in the ocean when
she was young._

.2+|*V2* |I går jobbet Markus i hagen. |_Yesterday, Markus worked in the
garden._

|Da Sofia var ung, svømte hun i havet. |_When Sofia was young, she
swam in the ocean._

### Verb Conjugation

Conjugating present tense of verbs in Norwegian is fairly simple. Most
present tense verbs just add an -r to the end of the infinitive.

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*
|Å svømme |Svømmer |_Swim(s)_ |Å sykle |Sykler |_Bike(s)_
|Å seile |Seiler |_Sail(s)_ |Å fiske |Fisker |_Fish(es)_
|===

There are some exceptions / irregulars:

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*
|Å kunne |Kan |To be able to |Å måtte |Må |To have to
|Å skulle |Skal |To have to; to be going to |Å ville |Vil |To want
|Å være |Er |_To be_ |Å vite |Vet |_To know_
|===

Past tense conjugation is a bit more difficult, however there are some
guidelines (but keep in mind there are exceptions).

[arabic]
. If the verb ends with a double consonant, consonant cluster, or voiced
plosive (b / d), past tense will end in -et.
. If the verb ends in a single consonant (except v / b / d), past tense
ends in -te.
. If the verb ends with v or diphthong, the past tense ends in -de.
. If the verb has only one syllable with a long vowel, past tense ends
in -dde.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Rule Number* |*Infinitive* |*Past Tense* |*English*
.2+|*1* |Å sna[.underline]##kk##e |Snakket |_Talked_
|Å ø[.underline]##nsk##e |Ønsket |_Wished_
.2+|*2* |Å læ[.underline]##r##e |Lærte |_Learned_
|Å kjø[.underline]##p##e |Kjøpte |_Bought_
.2+|*3* |Å le[.underline]##v##e |Levde |_Lived_
|Å pl[.underline]##ei##e |Pleide |_Used_
|*4* |Å b[.underline]##o## |Bodde |_Lived_
|===

For future tense, typically the present tense verb is used with a time
adverbial to clarify it is a future action.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Eksempel* |*English*
|De drar hjem på søndag. |_They are going home on Sunday._
|Festivalen er neste helg. |_The festival is next weekend._
|===

### Adjective Basics

Adjectives typically have to agree with the gender and the number of the
noun.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| 2.+|*Singular Indefinite* 2.+|*Plural Indefinite*

| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*

.2+|*Masculine* |En stor festival |_A big festival_ |Store festivaler |_Big
festivals_

|En tom kopp |_An empty cup_ |Tomme kopper |_Empty cups_

.2+|*Feminine* |Ei stor bok |_A big book_ |Store bøker |_Big books_

|Ei tom bokhylle |_An empty bookshelf_ |Tomme bokhyller |_Empty
bookshelves_

.2+|*Neuter* |Et stort bål |_A big bonfire_ |Store bål |_Big bonfires_

|Et tomt hus |_An empty house_ |Tomme hus |_Empty houses_
|===

When the noun is in the definite form, the adjective takes an -e ending
(like in the plural indefinite above).

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| 2.+|*Singular Definite* 2.+|*Plural Definite*

| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*

.2+|*Masculine* |Den store festivalen |_The big festival_ |De store

## Summer in Norway

Summertime is a great time to be in Norway. Temperatures in Norway
typically do not get above the 80s F (27 C), (however, lately Norway has
been experiencing higher-than-normal temperatures in the summer). If you
are in Norway in August, be prepared for plenty of rain. If you travel
above the Arctic Circle, the sun does not set during the summer months.
This phenomenon is called the midnight sun.

On 23 June, many Norwegians celebrate Sankthansaften (Midsummer Eve aka
St John’s Eve). Many attend parties with big bonfires (sankthansbål),
along the coast and up in the mountains. Some Norwegians will burn an
effigy of a witch on the bonfire (this originated from German
traditions).

With the long coastline and the beautiful mountains, summer is the
perfect time for swimming, fishing, boating, hiking, and camping. Some
Norwegians travel to “sommerbyer” (summer cities) along the coast. These
places are made up of white wooden houses along the narrow streets.

For thrill seekers, there are a number of
https://www.visitnorway.com/things-to-do/family-fun/theme-parks[[.underline]#amusement parks#] in Norway, including Tusenfryd in Oslo and a water park called
Bø Sommarland in Telemark. The entrance to Tusenfryd is reached via an
escalator that goes through one of the loops of Speed Monster, one of
Tusenfryd’s six coasters. The park also has a VR roller coaster called
Steampunk Hunters, as well as what is considered possibly the world’s
smallest roller coaster, at only 2.5 meters (8 ft) tall.

For music lovers, there are many music festivals that happen during the
summer months. One of the biggest music festivals is the Øya Festival
which takes place every August in Oslo and features indie, hip-hop, and
electronic music. The Slottsfjell Festival focuses on pop and rock music
and is held among the ruins of a medieval fortress in Tønsberg. The
Bukta open air music festival is a 3 day event taking place every summer
in Tromsø, featuring numerous rock artists. There are many other music
festivals in Norway, focusing on different genres of music, such as
jazz, blues, and contemporary music.
