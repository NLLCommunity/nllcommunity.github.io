== Grammar Review

=== Verb Conjugation

Conjugating the present tense of verbs in Norwegian is fairly simple.
Most present tense verbs just add an -r to the end of the infinitive,
and drop the infinitive marker (å).

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*
|Å lage |Lager |_Makes / Making_ |Å danse |Danser |_Dances / Dancing_
|Å sove |Sover |_Sleeps / Sleeping_ |Å lese |Leser |_Reads / Reading_
|===

There are some exceptions / irregulars:

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*
|Å kunne |Kan |To be able to |Å måtte |Må |To have to
|Å skulle |Skal |To have to; to be going to |Å ville |Vil |To want
|Å være |Er |_To be_ |Å vite |Vet |_To know_
|===

Past tense conjugation is a bit more difficult, however there are some
guidelines (but keep in mind there are exceptions).

[arabic]
. If the verb ends with a double consonant, consonant cluster, or voiced
plosive (b / d), past tense will end in -et.
. If the verb ends in a single consonant (except v / b / d), past tense
ends in -te.
. If the verb ends with v or diphthong, the past tense ends in -de.
. If the verb has only one syllable with a long vowel, past tense ends
in -dde.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Rule Number* |*Infinitive* |*Past Tense* |*English*
.2+|*1* |Å hente |hentet |_Fetched_
|Å savne |savnet |_Missed_
.2+|*2* |Å tape |Tapte |_Lost_
|Å kjøre |Kjørte |_Drove_
.2+|*3* |Å prøve |Prøvde |_Tried_
|Å feie |Feide |_Swept_
.2+|*4* |Å bo |Bodde |_Lived_
|Å bry |Brydde |_Cared_
|===

There are two ways to talk about future activities. Sometimes a present
tense verb + a time adverbial is used. Modal verbs are another way to
express future tense.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

|*Present Tense + Time Adverbial* |Faren min drar til biblioteket
senere. |_My dad is going to the library later._

|*Modal Verbs* |Gustav skal besøke broren sin. |_Gustav is going to
visit his brother._
|===

=== Adjective Basics

Adjectives typically have to agree with the gender and the number of the
noun. If the noun is neuter gender, then in the singular indefinite
form, the adjective takes a *-t ending*. In the plural indefinite, the
adjective takes an *-e ending*. Note there are exceptions.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| 2.+|*Singular Indefinite* 2.+|*Plural Indefinite*

| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*

.2+|*Masculine* |En dyr ring |_An expensive ring_ |Dyre ringer |_Expensive
rings_

|En kald drikke |_A cold beverage_ |Kalde drikker |_Cold beverages_

.2+|*Feminine* |Ei dyr bok |_An expensive book_ |Dyre bøker |_Expensive
books_

|Ei kald årstid |_A cold season_ |Kalde årstider |_Cold seasons_

.2+|*Neuter* |Et dyrt hus |_An expensive house_ |Dyre hus |_Expensive
houses_

|Et kaldt rom |_A cold room_ |Kalde rom |_Cold rooms_
|===

When the noun is in the definite form, the adjective takes an -e ending.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| 2.+|*Singular Definite* 2.+|*Plural Definite*

| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*

.2+|*Masculine* |Den dyre ringen |_The expensive ring_ |De dyre ringene
|_The expensive rings_

|Denne kalde drikken |_This cold beverage_ |Disse kalde drikkene
|_These cold beverages_

.2+|*Feminine* |Den dyre boka |_The expensive book_ |De dyre bøkene |_The
expensive books_

|Denne kalde årstida |_This cold season_ |Disse kalde årstidene
|_These cold seasons_

.2+|*Neuter* |Det dyre huset |_The expensive house_ |De dyre husa / husene
|_The expensive houses_

|Dette kalde rommet |_This cold room_ |Disse kalde romma / rommene
|_These cold rooms_
|===

== Basic Sentence Structure

This lesson will go over basic sentence structure in Norwegian,
including the V2 rule. Let’s start with question words, first, though.

=== Interrogatives

An interrogative word (also called a question word) is used to ask a
question, such as what, when, where, who(m), why, and how.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| |*Interrogative* |*Meaning* |*Example* |*English*

|*1* |Hva |_What_ |Hva er navnet hennes? |_What is her name?_

|*2* |Hvor |_Where_ |Hvor bor du? |_Where do you live?_

|*3* |Når |_When_ |Når begynner filmen? |_When does the movie begin?_

|*4* |Hvem |_Who_ |Hvem er moren din? |_Who is your mother?_

|*5* |Hvordan |_How_ |Hvordan skjedde ulykken? |_How did the accident
happen?_

|*6* |Hvorfor |_Why_ |Hvorfor ringte du ham? |_Why did you call him?_

|*7* |Hvor mye |_How much_ |Hvor mye koster det? |_How much does it
cost?_

|*8* |Hvor mange |_How many_ |Hvor mange søsken har du? |_How many
siblings do you have?_

|*9* |Hvor lenge |_How long_ |Hvor lenge har du lært norsk? |_How long
have you learned Norwegian?_

|*10* |Hvor høy(t) |_How high / tall_ |Hvor høyt er treet? |_How tall is
the tree?_

|*11* |Hvor lang(t) |_How far_ |Hvor langt unna er banken? |_How far
away is the bank?_

|*12* |Hvor gammel(t) |_How old_ |Hvor gammel er du? |_How old are you?_

|*13* a|
Hvem sin / sitt / si / sine

Hvis (archaic)

|_Whose_ |Hvem sin sykkel er dette? |_Whose bike is this?_

.3+|*14* .3+|Hvilken / Hvilket / Hvilke .3+|_Which_ |Hvilken farge er bilen din?
|_What color is your car?_

|Hvilket år ble du uteksaminert? |_What year did you graduate?_

|Hvilke bøker tilhører deg? |_Which books belong to you?_
|===

=== SVO & V2

Norwegian and English sentence structure are very similar; both follow a
subject-verb-object (SVO) sentence structure. However, there are some
instances in Norwegian when this is not the case, and for people
learning the language, it can take some getting used to.

First, let’s have a quick review of what a subject, verb, and object
are.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
|*Grammar Term* |*Definition* |*Example* |*Ask yourself...* |*English*

|*Subject* |Refers to a person or thing being discussed. .3+|Lucas drikker
te. |Who is drinking tea? +
 +
“Lucas,” so that is the subject. .3+|_Lucas drinks tea._

|*Verb* |Action taking place. |What is Lucas doing? +
 +
“Drikker,” so that is the verb..

|*Object* |Refers to the person or thing that is receiving the action.
|What is Lucas drinking? +
 +
“Te,” so that is the object.
|===

When the subject is first in the sentence, the sentence will follow the
SVO sentence structure.

[cols=",,,,,,",]
|===
|*Example* |*Subject* |*Verb* |*Adverb* |*Object* |*Adverbial +
Phrase* |*English*

|Jeg kjøpte en frakk i dag. |Jeg |kjøpte |---------- |en frakk |i dag.
|_I bought a coat today._

|Jeg kjøpte ikke en frakk i dag. |Jeg |kjøpte |ikke |en frakk |i dag.
|_I did not buy a coat today._

|Jeg spiste en vaffel i går. |Jeg |spiste |---------- |en vaffel |i går
|_I ate a waffle yesterday._
|===

*[.underline]#Note:#* Pay attention to the placement of “ikke” in the
above sentence.

As you can see, the Norwegian sentences and the English sentence both
have SVO. However, Norwegian has a V2 rule. This means that when the
subject of a sentence is displaced by another word or phrase, then the
subject and verb switch places, so that the verb remains in the second
position.

[cols=",,,,,,",]
|===
| |*Adverbial Phrase* |*Verb* |*Subject* |*Adverb* |*Object* |*English*

|I dag kjøpte jeg en frakk. |I dag |kjøpte |jeg |---------- |en frakk.
|_Today, I bought a coat._

|I dag kjøpte jeg ikke en frakk. |I dag |kjøpte |jeg |ikke |en frakk.
|_Today, I did not buy a coat._

|I dag kjøpte jeg ikke mat |I dag |kjøpte |jeg |ikke |mat |_Today, I did
not buy food_

|I dag laga grannen min mat til meg. |I dag |laga |grannen min |……...
|mat (til meg) |_Today my neighbour made food for me._
|===

As you can see, the adverbial phrase, “I dag,” is in the first position,
and so the verb, “kjøpte,” and the subject, “jeg,” are switched around.
If these were literally translated to English, that first sentence would
say, “Today bought I a coat,” and the second would say, “Today bought I
not a coat.”

When asking a question, inversion usually applies.

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Example* |*Interrogative* |*Verb* |*Subject* |*Object* |*English*

|Hvorfor lærer du norsk? |Hvorfor |lærer |du |norsk? |_Why are you
learning Norwegian?_

|Har du en bil? |-------------- |Har |du |en bil? |_Do you have a car?_
|===

If the question starts off with certain question words, there is no
inversion.

[cols=",,,,,,",]
|===
|*Example* |*Interrogative* |*Subject* |*Verb* |*Object* |*Pronoun*
|*English*

|Hvem har en bil? 2.+|Hvem |har |en bil? |--------------- |_Who has a car?_


|Hvem sitt hus er det? |Hvem sitt |hus |er |det? |----------------
|_Whose house is that?_

|Hvilket eple er ditt? |Hvilket |eple |er |--------- |ditt? |_Which
apple is yours?_
|===

=== Main Clauses & Subordinate Clauses

Many sentences are made up of a main clause and a subordinate clause.

*Main clause* _(sometimes called an “independent clause”)_ - forms a
complete sentence by itself; you could put a period at the end of a main
clause and it would make perfect sense.

*Subordinate clause* _(sometimes called a “dependent clause”_) - usually
begins with a subordinating conjunction (aka subjunction) and cannot
stand alone as a complete sentence, by itself; it is dependent on a main
clause. There are a lot of subjunctions; you can see a lesson plan on
them
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pt0Q9RjHs2Cl_JfI3A4xLgAtxgrsVTSaOx22mh1675M/edit?usp=sharing[[.underline]#here.#]

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Example* |*Main Clause* |*Subordinate Clause* |*English*

|Jeg er trøtt, fordi jeg jobbet i dag. |Jeg er trøtt |fordi jeg jobbet i
dag. |_I am tired because I worked today._

|Jeg spiste pizza siden jeg var sulten. |Jeg spiste pizza |siden jeg var
sulten. |_I ate pizza since I was hungry._

|Falch var glad fordi han hadde en venn med samme navn! |Falch var glad
|Fordi han hadde en venn med samme navn! |_Falch was happy because he
had a friend with the same name!_

|Jeg er sliten fordi jeg gikk på tur i 4 timer i dag. |Jeg er sliten
|Fordi jeg gikk på tur i 4 timer i dag |_I am tired because I went
hiking for 4 hours today._
|===

Notice in the subordinate clauses, in the above sentences, the subject
and verb are not inverted. However, if you were to place that entire
subordinate clause in the front of the sentence, take a look at what
happens to the main clause.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
|*Example* |*Subordinate Clause* 2.+|*Main Clause* |*English*

| |*(1st)* |*(2nd)* | |

|Siden jeg jobbet i dag, er jeg trøtt. |Siden jeg jobbet i dag, |er |jeg
trøtt |_Since I worked today, I am tired._

|Siden jeg var sulten, spiste jeg pizza. |Siden jeg var sulten, |spiste
|jeg pizza |_Since I was hungry, I ate pizza._

|Siden jeg var lat, stjal jeg en setning. |Siden jeg var lat |stjal |jeg
en setning |_Since I was lazy, I stole a sentence._

|Etter han hørte trommene, ble han gal. |Etter han hørte trommene, |ble
|Han gal |_After he heard the drums he became crazy._
|===

Inversion happens in the main clause because the subordinate clause is
in the first position (displacing the subject of the main clause). In
order to keep the verb in the second position, the verb and subject have
to switch places in the main clause.

*Let’s Practice:*

[cols=",",]
|===
|*English* |*Norwegian*

|When I visited Norway, I bought a Marius sweater. |Da jeg besøkte
Norge, kjøpte jeg en Marius genser.

|Since she was sick, she did not eat dinner. |Siden hun var syk, spiste
hun ikke middag.

|After he watched the movie, he went to bed. |Etter han så filmen, gikk
han til sengs.
|===

=== Adverbs

*Adverb* - word or phrase that describes a noun, adjective, or another
adverb.

The placement of an adverb, such as “ikke,” is dependent on if it is
located in the main clause or the subordinate clause and whether or not
there is inversion in the sentence.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| |*Main or Subordinate Clause* |*Adverb Position* |*Example* |*English*

.2+|*Without Inversion* |Main |_Placed after the conjugated verb_ |Jeg
[.underline]#kjøpte# *ikke* en frakk i dag. |_I did not buy a coat
today._

|Subordinate |_Placed before the conjugated verb_ |Jeg kjøpte en
frakk, siden den *ikke* [.underline]#var# dyr. |_I bought a coat since
it was not expensive._

.2+|*With Inversion* |Main |_Placed after the subject_ |I dag kjøpte
[.underline]#jeg# i**kke** en frakk. |_Today, I did not buy a coat._

|Subordinate |_Placed before the conjugated verb_ |Siden den *ikke*
[.underline]#var# dyr, kjøpte jeg frakken. |_Since it wasn’t expensive,
I bought the coat._
|===

*Let’s Practice: Put “ikke” in the correct location.*

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Eksempel* |*English*

|I går spilte han ikkje eit spill. |Yesterday, he did not play a game.

|Siden hun ikke spiste frokost, er hun sulten. |Since she didn’t eat
breakfast, she’s hungry.

|Jeg spiste ikke pizza til lunsj. |I did not eat pizza for lunch.

|På grunn av det dårlige været, er svømmebassenget ikke åpent. |Due to
the bad weather, the pool is not open.

|Siden han ikke hadde penger, dro han ikke til konserten. |Since he
didn’t have money, he didn’t go to the concert.
|===

If the sentence contains a compound verb (i.e. har brukt; har besøkt,
etc), the adverb comes after the finite (conjugated) verb in the
compound.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Eksempel* |*English*

|Jeg har ikke brukt den nye frakken min ennå. |I have not used my new
coat yet.

|Jeg har ikke besøkt norge, fordi grunner. |I have not visited Norway,
because _reasons._

|Fordi han alltid hørte trommene, kunne han ikke få fred. |Because he
always heard the drums he couldn’t be at peace.
|===

If a pronoun is added to a sentence, the placement can vary. It’s added
in one of three different ways:

[arabic]
. Often it’s a preposition
. Sometimes, it’s an indirect object, placed between the verb and
adverb.
. Sometimes, it’s an indirect object, placed after the adverb.

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* When used as an indirect object, placement depends
on the emphasis in the sentence.

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Placement* |*Eksempel* |*English*

|*Preposition* |Jeg kjøpte ikke en frakk til henne i dag. |I did not buy
her a coat today.

a|
*Indirect Object:*

*Between Verb & Adverb*

|Jeg ga henne ikke en gave i dag. |I did not give her *_a gift_* today.

a|
*Indirect Object:*

*After Adverb*

|Jeg ga ikke henne en gave i dag. |I did not give *_her_* a gift today.
|===

Here are some additional adverbs that are frequently used:

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|_Aldri_ |Never |_Alltid_ |Always
|_Muligvis_ |Possibly |_Allerede_ |Already
|_Ofte_ |Often |_Kanskje_ |Maybe
|_Snart_ |Soon |_Sikkert_ |Certainly
|_Sannsynligvis_ |Probably |_Virkelig_ |Really
|===

=== Frequency Indicators

Frequency indicators indicate the frequency of an action. Frequency
indicators can move around in a sentence. Some examples of frequency
indicators are:

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|Ofte |_Often_ |Jevnlig |_Frequently, evenly_
|Sjeldent |_Rarely_ |Av og til |_Sometimes_
|Nå og da |_Now and then_ |Noen ganger |_Sometimes_
|===

Ex: Kommer du ofte hit?

Kommer du hit ofte?

Do you come here often?
