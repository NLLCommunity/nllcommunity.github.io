The new year is right around the corner, many Norwegians make New Year’s
resolutions (nyttårsforsett), attend parties, and drink champagne, but
those are not the only things that Norwegians do to ring in the New
Year.

**Speech**

On New Year’s Eve, at 7:30pm, Norway’s King Harald V makes a speech that
many Norwegians watch. NRK has aired the speech every year since 1960.
(TV2 now also airs the King’s speech and the speech can also be listened
to on the radio). During the speech, King Harald briefly summarizes
major events, national and global, that had happened during the year.
The tradition of the King’s New Year’s speech started with King Haakon
VII in the early 1900s.

**Food**

People attending parties in Norway typically bring at least one dish,
either a main course, side dish, or dessert. Foods that are commonly
eaten on New Year’s Eve include turkey, lamb, pork, or reindeer, along
with side dishes, such as potatoes. This is followed up with dessert,
such as [<span class="underline">panna
cotta</span>](https://youtu.be/twv6m30Ve38), chocolate mousse,
[<span class="underline">pavlova</span>](https://www.tine.no/oppskrifter/kaker/krem-og-sjokoladekaker/pavlovakake-til-17.mai),
[<span class="underline">multekrem</span>](https://www.196flavors.com/norway-multekrem/),
and leftover kransekake (if there is any left from Christmas).

**Wiener Musikverein**

The New Year’s concert from Vienna is aired on NRK with approximately
500,000 Norwegians tuning in.

**Nyttårsbukk**

In some places in Norway, young children get dressed up, and go
door-to-door, singing Christmas songs in exchange for candy, on New
Year’s Eve. This tradition is called nyttårsbukk.

**Midnight**

As it gets close to midnight, many will go outside to set off small
fireworks and light sparklers. There are strict rules as to where and
what kind of fireworks individuals are allowed to set off. Larger
municipalities set off their own professional fireworks display at
midnight. Unfortunately, due to the fireworks, New Year’s tends to be
the busiest time of year for the fire department.

**New Year’s Day**

On New Year’s Day, most people just relax, and some Norwegians will
attend church. Most of the shops will be closed on this day. The Prime
Minister makes a speech on New Year’s Day, discussing the previous year
in politics, which many Norwegians watch.
