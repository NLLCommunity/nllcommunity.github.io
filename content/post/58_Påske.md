While many Norwegians are not Christian, the Easter holiday is still
widely celebrated throughout the country. It is a great time to spend
with family and friends and welcome the coming of spring.

Norway has one of the longest Easter celebration / holiday breaks in the
world. It begins on Maundy Thursday (the Thursday before Easter) and
lasts until the Monday following Easter (known as “the second Easter
day”). Many people have off work during this time and schools are closed
the entire week before Easter.

**The Days of Easter**

Easter (and Passover) is called “påske” in Norwegian which derives from
the Hebrew word “Pesach / Pasah” meaning “Passover.” While Easter is
largely a secular celebration in Norway, remnants of the religious
aspects still remain. To understand some traditions and the days’ names,
let’s look at a brief overview of the religious significance of each
day. **<span class="underline">Please note:</span>** This is not meant
to be a debate about whether these religious events are or are not
“factual.” That is up to the reader to decide for themselves.

In Christianity, Palm Sunday (palmesøndag) marks the day that Jesus
arrived in Jerusalem. Palm leaves (or leaves from other native trees)
are typically handed out at many churches throughout the world, to
represent the palm branches that the crowd had laid in front of Jesus as
he entered the city.

Maundy Thursday (skjærtorsdag) is the Thursday before Easter. In
Christianity, Maundy Thursday was the day that Jesus washed the feet of
his apostles and the day that the Last Supper took place.

Good Friday (langfredag) commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus in
Christianity. It sometimes coincides with the Jewish observance of
Passover, which celebrates their freedom from slavery in ancient Egypt.

Christians celebrate Easter (påskesøndag) as the day that Jesus was
resurrected from the dead.

Easter is celebrated on a different date each year because it is based
on a lunar calendar. It is celebrated on the first Sunday after the
first full moon on or after March 21.

**Traditions and Decorations**

There had been an “Easter” holiday celebration by Norwegians before it
became a Christian holiday, as it was just a celebration of the coming
spring. Some traditions (and symbols) from pre-Christian celebrations
for spring have been altered over time but are still a part of Easter
celebrations in Norway today.

There are not really any secular traditions associated with Palm Sunday
(other than it marks the start of the holiday week for students).
However, some churches organize “[<span class="underline">palm
processions</span>](https://youtu.be/n2e8xfZsR_o)” on this day.

While students have off school from Sunday, most people work Monday
through Wednesday. Maundy Thursday is the official start to their
holiday break and many take this opportunity to go shopping, go to their
cabin, or go skiing.

While Maundy Thursday is an official holiday in Norway, it is not in
Sweden and so many Norwegians travel to Sweden to go Easter shopping.
Sometimes this day is referred to as “Sverigedag.”

Though many Norwegians choose to celebrate Easter at home, many others
go to their cabin and / or go skiing. Two things that most Norwegians
will have with them, to eat as snacks while at the cabin or skiing, are
oranges and Kvikk Lunsj.

In old days, Norwegians thought that the witches went to a place called
Bloksberg on Maundy Thursday. Many Norwegians would put a broom outside
their door, for the witches to take. They believed that if they didn’t,
a witch would take a cow or sheep from them instead. Today, small brooms
are a common Easter decoration in a lot of Norwegian homes.

Other common decorations during Easter are daffodils, yellow chickens,
rabbits, decorated eggshells (this is done by blowing the insides of the
egg out, leaving just the shell to be painted); and “påskekvist” which
are small twigs that are decorated with painted eggs. The color yellow
is very common during this time of year, as well.

Good Friday is one of 3 days that Norway does not air commercials on
television (however charity ads do run). Several churches in Norway
organize [<span
class="underline">processions</span>](https://youtu.be/XfB-98lac1w)
where a cross is carried in commemoration of the crucifixion. The Church
City Mission (Kirkens Bymisjon) in Oslo organizes such a procession in
the city.

Early Saturday (påskeaften) is typically when cardboard or plastic
easter eggs (påskeegg), decorated with an Easter theme and filled with
candy, are hidden around the home or yard for the children to search for
and find. Afterward, children watch “Påskemorgen” which is a children’s
show that airs each day of the Easter holiday.

<img src="/images/påske/image4.png" style="width:4.11381in;height:2.29688in" />

Saturday afternoon is usually when the family has their Easter meal
together. Typically a leg of lamb is eaten (a tradition stemming from
Christianity; some believe that lamb was eaten during the Last Supper;
additionally Jesus is considered the “Lamb of God”).

Many churches in Norway will arrange special services in the late
evening, starting around 11pm and lasting till 1am. Candles are often
lit during the service.

Easter Sunday (første påskedag) begins with an Easter breakfast that
usually includes freshly baked bread and dyed boiled eggs. Some children
also get Easter eggs on this day, often left by the Easter bunny
(påskehare). Unlike in some countries, the Easter bunny is not really a
major figure during the holiday.

The Monday after Easter is called “Second Easter” (andre påskedag). For
those who had travelled over the Easter week, this is a day to pack up
and return home and get ready for work the following day. For those who
didn’t travel, it’s just a day to relax before work begins again.

**Påskekrim**

One of the most interesting Easter traditions in Norway is that of
“påskekrim.” During the Easter holiday, fictional crime thrillers /
dramas are all the rage. Many Norwegians will read crime thriller books
or stories in magazines.The book stores will have an entire section
titled “påskekrim” with crime thrillers on sale. There are [<span
class="underline">radio</span>](https://radio.nrk.no/podkast/radioteatrets_paaskekrim/nrkno-poddkast-26587-152777-13042019040000)
and tv crime drama shows that are often aired in parts (one part each
day) during the Easter week. The milk company will even put small crime
thrillers on their milk cartons for people to solve.

<img src="/images/påske/image5.png" style="width:5.64063in;height:4.79551in" />

It is believed that this tradition of påskekrim came from the 1920s when
a publishing company ran an ad on the front cover of Aftenposten, for a
crime story. The advertisement had a title that read, “Bergenstoget
Plyndret I Natt” (Bergen Train Looted in the Night) and looked like a
standard news headline. The “article” advertised the new crime book by
Nordahl Grieg and Nils Lie. The book sold quite well, prompting
publishing companies to push out more crime thrillers during the Easter
holiday the following year. And thus, a tradition was born.
