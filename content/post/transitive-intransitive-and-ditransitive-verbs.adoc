When learning about verbs in Norwegian, often you will come across the
words “transitive” and “intransitive.” I thought it would be a good idea
to explain these concepts.

== Grammar Review

=== Sentence structure

While most Norwegian sentences use the subject-verb-object (SVO) word
order, like English does, Norwegian does have the V2 (verb second) rule.
If an adverbial phrase or subordinate clause is at the front of the
sentence, the subject and the verb have to switch places (this is called
“inversion”) so that the verb stays in the second position.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.2+|*SVO* |Lukas ventet på vennene sine etter skoletid. |_Lukas waited for
his friends after school._

|Tiril satt barnevakt for broren sin mens foreldrene deres jobbet.
|_Tiril babysat her brother while their parents worked._

.2+|*V2* |Etter skoletid ventet Lukas på vennene sine. |_After school,
Lukas waited for his friends._

|Mens foreldrene deres jobbet, satt Tiril barnevakt for broren sin.
|_While their parents worked, Tiril babysat her brother._
|===

If a sentence has more than one verb, the second verb will be in a
nonfinite form (e.g. å finne). If the sentence has inversion, then the
subject will come between the finite (i.e. conjugated) verb and the
nonfinite verb.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.2+|*SVO* |Faren min liker å jakte om vinteren. |_My father likes to hunt
in the winter._

|Elias prøvde å lage et armbånd etter at han så på en
instruksjonsvideo. |_Elias tried to make a bracelet after he watched a
tutorial._

.2+|*V2* |Om vinteren liker faren min å jakte. |_In the winter, my father
likes to hunt._

|Etter at Elias så på en instruksjonsvideo, prøvde han å lage et
armbånd. |_After Elias watched a tutorial, he tried to make a bracelet._

=== Verb Conjugation

Conjugating present tense of verbs in Norwegian is fairly simple. Most
present tense verbs just add an -r to the end of the infinitive.

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*
|Å rope |roper |_Yells / Yelling_ |Å bygge |bygger |_Builds / Building_
|Å vinne |vinner |_Wins / Winning_ |Å tape |taper |_Loses / Losing_
|===

There are some exceptions / irregulars:

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*
|Å kunne |Kan |To be able to |Å måtte |Må |To have to
|Å skulle |Skal |To have to; to be going to |Å ville |Vil |To want
|Å være |Er |_To be_ |Å vite |Vet |_To know_
|===

Past tense conjugation is a bit more difficult, however there are some
guidelines (but keep in mind there are exceptions).

[arabic]
. If the verb ends with a double consonant, consonant cluster, or voiced
plosive (b / d), past tense will end in -et.
. If the verb ends in a single consonant (except v / b / d), past tense
ends in -te.
. If the verb ends with v or diphthong, the past tense ends in -de.
. If the verb has only one syllable with a long vowel, past tense ends
in -dde.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Rule Number* |*Infinitive* |*Past Tense* |*English*
.2+|*1* |Å sparke |Sparket |_Kicked_
|Å fikse |Fikset |_Fixed_
.2+|*2* |Å svare |Svarte |_Answered_
|Å besøke |Besøkte |_Visited_
.2+|*3* |Å trave |travde |_Trotted_
|Å feie |feide |_Swept_
.2+|*4* |Å ha |hadde |_Had_
|Å snu |snudde |_Flipped_
|===

For future tense, often the present tense verb is used with a time
adverbial to clarify it is a future action. (*[.underline]#Note#*: There
are ways to form future sentences using modals; that is covered in a
more in-depth lesson).

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Eksempel* |*English*

|Henrik drar til Trondheim neste uke. |_Henrik is going to Trondheim
next week._

|Jeg tar oppvasken senere i kveld. |_I’ll wash the dishes later
tonight._
|===

=== Adjective Basics

Adjectives typically have to agree with the gender and the number of the
noun. If the noun is neuter gender, then in the singular indefinite
form, the adjective takes a *-t ending*. In the plural indefinite, the
adjective takes an *-e ending*. Note there are exceptions.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| 2.+|*Singular Indefinite* 2.+|*Plural Indefinite*
| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*
.2+|*Masculine* |En rask bil |_A fast car_ |Raske biler |_Fast cars_
|En falsk lisens |_A fake license_ |Falske lisenser |_Fake licenses_
.2+|*Feminine* |Ei rask bie |_A fast bee_ |Raske bier |_Fast bees_
|Ei falsk melding |_A fake message_ |Falske meldinger |_Fake messages_
.2+|*Neuter* |Et raskt barn |_A fast child_ |Raske barn |_Fast children_
|Et falskt bilde |_A fake picture_ |Faske bilder |_Fake pictures_
|===

When the noun is in the definite form, the adjective takes an -e ending.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| 2.+|*Singular Definite* 2.+|*Plural Definite*

| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*

.2+|*Masculine* |Den raske bilen |_The fast car_ |De raske bilene |_The
fast cars_

|Denne falske lisensen |_This fake license_ |Disse falske lisensene
|_These fake licenses_

.2+|*Feminine* |Den raske bia |_The fast bee_ |De raske biene |_The fast
bees_

|Denne falske meldinga |_This fake message_ |Disse falske meldingene
|_These fake messages_

.2+|*Neuter* |Det raske barnet |_The fast child_ |De raske barna / barnene
|_The fast children_

|Dette falske bildet |_This fake picture_ |Disse falske bilda /
bildene |_These fake pictures_

== Transitive, Intransitive, Etc.

Some verbs require a direct object while others do not. Sometimes they
differ from how the verbs are used in English.

=== Transitive Verbs

Transitive verbs have a direct object (that is, the person or object
receiving the action).

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Norwegian Sentence* |*Transitive Verb* |*Direct Object* |*English
Translation*

|Nils malte portrettet. |malte |portrettet |_Nils painted the portrait._

|Synnøve ringte moren sin. |ringte |Moren sin |_Synnøve called her
mother._
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* Some transitive verbs can be used intransitively
(i.e. that is, without a direct object). In these cases, the direct
object is implied though not stated.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Norwegian Sentence* |*Transitive Verb* |*(Implied Direct Object)*
|*English Translation*

|Vi spiser kl.18. |spiser |mat |_We eat at 6pm._

|Gustav kjører på jobb. |kjører |bilen sin |_Gustav drives to work._
|===

*Some additional examples of “latent” transitive verbs:*

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|Å drikke |_To drink_ |Å hjelpe |_To help_
|Å tape |_To lose_ |Å vinne |_To win_
|===

There are some verbs that do not need a direct object in English however
they must contain a direct object in Norwegian.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Norwegian Sentence* |*Transitive Verb* |*Direct Object* |*English
Translation*

|Jeg forlot huset tidlig. |forlot |huset |_I left (the house) early._

|De kysset hverandre. |kysset |hverandre |_They kissed (each other)._
|===

As you can see in the English translations of the above sentences, you
could omit the parts in parenthesis and the sentence would still be
correct.

=== Ditransitive Verbs

Ditransitive verbs have both a direct object and an indirect object
(that is, it refers to a person or thing that is affected by the action
but is not the recipient).

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
|*Norwegian Sentence* |*Ditransitive Verb* |*Indirect Object* |*Direct
Object* |*English Translation*

|Pia gav Emil en gave. |gav |Emil |gave |_Pia gave Emil a gift._

|Fanny fortalte Lars en hemmelighet. |fortalte |Lars |hemmelighet
|_Fanny told Lars a secret._
|===

*Some additional examples of ditransitive verbs:*

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|Å love |_To promise_ |Å låne |_To lend_
|Å sende |_To send_ |Å misunne |_To envy_
|Å si |_To say_ | |
|===

=== Intransitive Verbs

Intransitive verbs do not have a direct object.

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Norwegian Sentence* |*Intransitive Verb* |*English Translation*
|Hunden sover. |sover |_The dog is sleeping._
|Faren hans døde i går. |døde |_His father died yesterday._
|===

*Some additional examples of intransitive verbs:*

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|Å gråte |_To weep_ |Å fryse |_To be cold / freeze_
|Å lyve |_To (tell a) lie_ | |
|===

There are some transitive and intransitive verbs that exist in pairs,
that have related meanings. Here’s some examples; notice that some might
be spelled the same in present tense but not in past or perfect tenses.

[cols=",,,,,,,",]
|===
| |*Infinitive* |*English* |*Present* |*Past* |*Perfect* |*Eksempel*
|*English*

|*Transitive* |Å legge a|
_To lay;_

_to put_

|legger |la |lagt |Han la boka på bordet. |_He put the book on the
table._

|*Intransitive* |Å ligge |_To lie_ |ligger |lå |ligget |Han lå hele
dagen. |_He lied (in bed) all day._

|*Transitive* |Å sette a|
_To set;_

_to place,_

_to put_

|setter |satte |satt |Hun satte koppen på bordet. |_She put the cup on
the table._

|*Intransitive* |Å sitte |_To sit_ |sitter |satt |sittet |Jeg satt på
kontoret i en time. |_I sat in the office for an hour._

|*Transitive* |Å henge |_To hang up_ |henger |hengte |hengt |Han hengte
jakken sin i skapet. |_He hung his jacket up in the closet._

|*Intransitive* |Å henge |_To hang_ |henger |hang |hengt |Jakken hans
hang i skapet. |_His jacket was hanging in the closet._

|*Transitive* |Å rekke a|
_To reach,_

_to pass_

|rekker |rakte |rakt |Han rakte meg hånden sin. |_He offered me his
hand._

|*Intransitive* |Å rekke |_To reach_ |rekker |rakk |rukket |Juletreet
rakk helt i taket. |_The Christmas tree reached all the way to the
ceiling._
|===

As you can see, whether a verb is transitive or intransitive can change
how it is conjugated, particularly in the past tense.

=== Copulas

Another term you might come across is “copula.” These are “empty verbs”
that need a subject complement (usually an adjective or noun), instead
of an object. The most common copulas are “bli” and “være.” Copulas
usually indicate either the state of something or imply change.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Norwegian Sentence* |*Copula* |*Subject Complement* |*English
translation*

|Erik ble ingeniør. |ble |ingeniør |_Erik became an engineer._

|De er veldig søte. |er |søte |_They are very sweet / cute._
