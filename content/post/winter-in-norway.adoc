== Grammar Review

===  Sentence structure

While most Norwegian sentences use the subject-verb-object (SVO) word
order, like English does, Norwegian does have the V2 (verb second) rule.
If an adverbial phrase or subordinate clause is at the front of the
sentence, the subject and the verb have to switch places (this is called
“inversion”) so that the verb stays in the second position.

|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.2+|*SVO* |Erik spilte det nye spillet i går. |_Erik played the new game
yesterday._

|Emilie hadde på seg sin nye frakken siden det var kaldt ute. |_Emilie
wore her new coat since it was cold outside._

.2+|*V2* |I går spilte Erik det nye spillet. |_Yesterday, Erik played the
new game._

|Siden det var kaldt ute, hadde Emilie på seg sin nye frakken. |_Since
it was cold outside, Emilie wore her new coat._
|===

If a sentence has more than one verb, the second verb will be in a
nonfinite form (e.g. å finne). If the sentence has inversion, then the
subject will come between the finite (i.e. conjugated) verb and the
nonfinite verb.

.2+|*SVO* |Sofie begynte å spille fotball i fjor. |_Sofie began playing
football last year._

|Lukas prøvde å synge en ny sang på generalprøven i går. |_Lukas tried
to sing a new song at rehearsal yesterday.l_

.2+|*V2* |I fjor begynte Sofie å spille fotball. |_Last year, Sofie began
playing football._

|På generalprøven i går prøvde Lukas å synge en ny sang. |_At
rehearsal yesterday, Lukas tried to sing a new song._

=== Verb Conjugation

Conjugating present tense of verbs in Norwegian is fairly simple. Most
present tense verbs just add an -r to the end of the infinitive.

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*

|Å tegne |Tegner |_Draws / Drawing_ |Å spille |Spiller |_Plays /
Playing_

|Å synge |Synger |_Sings / Singing_ |Å løpe |Løper |_Runs / Running_
|===

There are some exceptions / irregulars:

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*
|Å kunne |Kan |To be able to |Å måtte |Må |To have to
|Å skulle |Skal |To have to; to be going to |Å ville |Vil |To want
|Å være |Er |_To be_ |Å vite |Vet |_To know_
|===

Past tense conjugation is a bit more difficult, however there are some
guidelines (but keep in mind there are exceptions).

[arabic]
. If the verb ends with a double consonant, consonant cluster, or voiced
plosive (b / d), past tense will end in -et.
. If the verb ends in a single consonant (except v / b / d), past tense
ends in -te.
. If the verb ends with v or diphthong, the past tense ends in -de.
. If the verb has only one syllable with a long vowel, past tense ends
in -dde.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Rule Number* |*Infinitive* |*Past Tense* |*English*
.2+|*1* |Å sna[.underline]##kk##e |Snakket |_Talked_
|Å ø[.underline]##nsk##e |Ønsket |_Wished_
.2+|*2* |Å læ[.underline]##r##e |Lærte |_Learned_
|Å kjø[.underline]##p##e |Kjøpte |_Bought_
.2+|*3* |Å le[.underline]##v##e |Levde |_Lived_
|Å pl[.underline]##ei##e |Pleide |_Used_
|*4* |Å b[.underline]##o## |Bodde |_Lived_
|===

For future tense, typically the present tense verb is used with a time
adverbial to clarify it is a (near) future action. Modal verbs can also
be used to express future actions.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Eksempel* |*English*

|Isabella kjører til butikken i morgen. |_Isabella will drive to the
store tomorrow._

|Butikken åpner neste helg. |_The store is opening next weekend._
|===

=== Adjective Basics

Adjectives typically have to agree with the gender and the number of the
noun.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| 2.+|*Singular Indefinite* 2.+|*Plural Indefinite*

| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*

.2+|*Masculine* |En varm genser |_A warm sweater_ |Varme gensere |_Warm
sweaters_

|En rød hanske |_A red glove_ |Røde hansker |_Red gloves_

.2+|*Feminine* |Ei varm kåpe |_A warm robe_ |Varme kåper |_Warm robes_

|Ei rød hytte |_A red cabin_ |Røde hytter |_Red cabins_

.2+|*Neuter* |Et varmt teppe |_A warm blanket_ |Varme tepper |_Warm
blankets_

|Et rødt skjerf |_A red scarf_ |Røde skjerf |_Red scarves_
|===

When the noun is in the definite form, the adjective takes an -e ending
(like in the plural indefinite above).

== Winter in Norway

=== Weather

Winter officially starts in December and ends in February, however, it
is not uncommon to see snow in November in Norway (sometimes even as
early as October). Furthermore, snow can linger into April, depending on
the area in Norway. Typically, the temperatures during the winter months
are below the freezing point (0 C / 32 F) with the temperature in some
areas dropping as low as -40 C / F. The coldest months tend to be
January and February. If you’re not particularly fond of cold weather,
then Oslo has some of the warmer temperatures during the winter months.

Winter days are very short and the nights are long. In areas north of
the Arctic Circle, the sun doesn’t even rise from November til January.
Winter is a good time to see the Northern Lights (nordlys) in areas of
Northern Norway, especially around the coasts of Tromsø.

=== Things to Do

There are a number of things to do and see in Norway during the winter.
Of course, one of the most popular things to do in the winter is skiing,
whether it be
https://www.visitnorway.com/things-to-do/great-outdoors/skiing/cross-country-skiing/[cross-country]
or
https://www.visitnorway.com/things-to-do/great-outdoors/skiing/alpine-skiing/[alpine].
If you don’t want to ski, you can strap on some snowshoes and go on a
hike. If you’re going to go skiing or hiking, however, make sure that
you check the weather forecast and also follow the
https://www.visitnorway.com/plan-your-trip/safety-first/mountain-safety/the-mountain-code/[Norwegian
mountain code] (fjellvettreglene).

If you enjoy fishing during the summer, why not fish in the winter also?
Fishing spots aren’t as busy or crowded, allowing for better chances of
catching fish. Due to the Gulf Stream, a lot of the fjords remain
ice-free and the waters that are frozen, you can drill a hole in the
ice, put your line in and wait for the fish to bite. After winter
fishing, many will relax in a sauna or in front of an open fire.

https://www.visitnorway.com/things-to-do/great-outdoors/dog-sledding/[Dog 
sledding] is another activity one can experience during the winter in
Norway. As part of many dog sledding tours, one can pet and feed the
huskies. You can either choose to be the musher yourself or you can just
enjoy being a passenger along for the ride. Just be aware that it can be
a work out, if you choose to drive your own team of dogs.

If you’re looking at unique places to visit or stay the night, you can
see the https://youtu.be/VCoP2F6nh-0[Sorrisniva Igloo
Hotel] and the https://youtu.be/63Wd_RPZVxQ[Kirkenes Snow
Hotel], both located in Northern Norway. Both hotels are built over the
course of a number of weeks in November / December, and feature ice and
snow sculptures, beautiful lighting, and different themes each year.

One of the most important aspects of Norwegian winters is the concept of
“kos.” The word loosely translates into English as “coziness” but can be
explained as that warm feeling you get when you’re with family and / or
friends, having a relaxing and enjoyable time. The word might bring to
mind the image of sitting in front of a fireplace, with a warm cup of
hot chocolate (or tea or coffee), wearing a warm marius sweater, and
enjoying the company of one’s friends. Of course “kos” can also mean
sitting on the couch, snuggled closely with a significant other,
watching old movies, or having a game of cards with some friends. It’s a
feeling of closeness, happiness, kindness, and belonging.

No matter what winter activities you are enjoying, be aware that when
traveling, there will be a lot of closed roads due to the weather.
Furthermore, if you are driving, make sure that your car has studded
winter tires or snow chains, etc. It’s also a good idea to keep a
blanket, snacks, and a shovel, just in case you get stuck someplace.
