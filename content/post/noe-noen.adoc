== Grammar Review

===  Sentence Structure

While most Norwegian sentences use the subject-verb-object (SVO) word
order, like English does, Norwegian does have the V2 (verb second) rule.
If an adverbial phrase or subordinate clause is at the front of the
sentence, the subject and the verb have to switch places (this is called
“inversion”) so that the verb stays in the second position.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.2+|*SVO* |Tobias spiste kake etter middagen. |_Tobias ate cake after
dinner._

|Nora brukte en paraply siden det regnet. |_Nora used an umbrella
since it rained._

.2+|*V2* |Etter middagen spiste Tobias kake |_After dinner, Tobias ate
cake._

|Siden det regnet, brukte Nora en paraply. |_Since it rained, Nora
used an umbrella._
|===

If a sentence has more than one verb, the second verb will be in a
nonfinite form (e.g. å finne). If the sentence has inversion, then the
subject will come between the finite (i.e. conjugated) verb and the
nonfinite verb.

| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.2+|*SVO* |Markus prøvde å ringe vennen sin i går. |_Markus tried to call
his friend yesterday._

|Karina pleide å jobbe på et sykehus da hun bodde i Oslo. |_Karina
used to work in a hospital when she lived in Oslo._

.2+|*V2* |I går prøvde Markus å ringe vennen sin. |_Yesterday, Markus tried
to call his friend._

|Da Karina bodde i Oslo, pleide hun å jobbe på et sykehus. |_When
Karina lived in Oslo, she used to work in a hospital._

=== Verb Conjugation

Conjugating the present tense of verbs in Norwegian is fairly simple.
Most present tense verbs just add an -r to the end of the infinitive,
and drop the infinitive marker (å).

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*

|Å sparke |sparker |_Kicks / Kicking_ |Å hjelpe |hjelper |_Helps /
Helping_

|Å mumle |mumler |_Mutters / Muttering_ |Å tape |taper |_Loses / Losing_
|===

There are some exceptions / irregulars:

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*
|Å kunne |Kan |To be able to |Å måtte |Må |To have to
|Å skulle |Skal |To have to; to be going to |Å ville |Vil |To want
|Å være |Er |_To be_ |Å vite |Vet |_To know_
|===

Past tense conjugation is a bit more difficult, however there are some
guidelines (but keep in mind there are exceptions).

[arabic]
. If the verb ends with a double consonant, consonant cluster, or voiced
plosive (b / d), past tense will end in -et.
. If the verb ends in a single consonant (except v / b / d), past tense
ends in -te.
. If the verb ends with v or diphthong, the past tense ends in -de.
. If the verb has only one syllable with a long vowel, past tense ends
in -dde.

|===
|*Rule Number* |*Infinitive* |*Past Tense* |*English*
.2+|*1* |Å sparke |sparket |_Kicked_
|Å mumle |mumlet |_Mumbled_
.2+|*2* |Å tape |tapte |_Lost (to lose)_
|Å lære |lærte |_Learned_
.2+|*3* |Å eie |eide |_Owned_
|Å leve |levde |_Lived_
.2+|*4* |Å spy |spydde |_Threw up_
|Å ha |hadde |_Had_
|===

There are two ways to talk about future activities. Sometimes a present
tense verb + a time adverbial is used. Another way to express future
tense is with modal verbs.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

|*Present Tense + Time Adverbial* |Mathias spiller spillet senere.
|_Mathias will play the game later._

|*Modal Verbs* |Tanten min skal bake bursdagskaken. |_My aunt will bake
the birthday cake._

=== *Adjective Basics*

Adjectives typically have to agree with the gender and the number of the
noun. If the noun is neuter gender, then in the singular indefinite
form, the adjective takes a *-t ending*. In the plural indefinite, the
adjective takes an *-e ending*. Note there are exceptions.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| 2.+|*Singular Indefinite* 2.+|*Plural Indefinite*

| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*

.2+|*Masculine* |En gul banan |_A yellow banana_ |Gule bananer |_Yellow
bananas_

|En ren tallerken |_A clean plate_ |Rene tallerkener |_Clean plates_

.2+|*Feminine* |Ei gul lampe |_A yellow lamp_ |Gule lamper |_Yellow lamps_

|Ei ren jakke |_A clean jacket_ |Rene jakker |_Clean jackets_

.2+|*Neuter* |Et gult eple |_A yellow apple_ |gule epler |_Yellow apples_

|Et rent rom |_A clean room_ |rene rom |_Clean rooms_
|===

When the noun is in the definite form, the adjective takes an -e ending.
