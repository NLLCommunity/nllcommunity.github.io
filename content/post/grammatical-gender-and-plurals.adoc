## Grammar Review

### Sentence structure

While most Norwegian sentences use the subject-verb-object (SVO) word
order, like English does, Norwegian does have the V2 (verb second) rule.
If an adverbial phrase or subordinate clause is at the front of the
sentence, the subject and the verb have to switch places (this is called
“inversion”) so that the verb stays in the second position.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.2+|*SVO* |Erik syklet på jobb i går. |_Erik biked to work yesterday._

|Nora leser ei bok i lunsjpausen sin. |_Nora reads a book during her
lunch break._

.2+|*V2* |I går syklet Erik på jobb. |_Yesterday, Erik biked to work._

|I lunsjpausen sin leser Nora ei bok. |_During her lunch break, Nora
reads a book._
|===

If a sentence has more than one verb, the second verb will be in a
nonfinite form (e.g. å finne). If the sentence has inversion, then the
subject will come between the finite (i.e. conjugated) verb and the
nonfinite verb.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.2+|*SVO* |Jakob begynte å lage middag da han kom hjem. |_Jakob started
making dinner when he came home._

|Sofia lærte å svømme i fjor sommer. |_Sofia learned to swim last
summer._

.2+|*V2* |Da Jakob kom hjem, begynte han å lage middag. |_When Jakob came
home, he started making dinner._

|I fjor sommer lærte Sofia å svømme. |_Last summer, Sofia learned to
swim._
|===

### Verb Conjugation

Conjugating present tense of verbs in Norwegian is fairly simple. Most
present tense verbs just add an -r to the end of the infinitive.

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*

|Å kjøpe |Kjøper |_Buys / Buying_ |Å sykle |Sykler |_Bikes / Biking_

|Å lese |Leser |_Reads / Reading_ |Å studere |Studerer |_Studies /
Studying_
|===

There are some exceptions / irregulars:

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*
|Å kunne |Kan |To be able to |Å måtte |Må |To have to
|Å skulle |Skal |To have to; to be going to |Å ville |Vil |To want
|Å være |Er |_To be_ |Å vite |Vet |_To know_
|===

Past tense conjugation is a bit more difficult, however there are some
guidelines (but keep in mind there are exceptions).

[arabic]
. If the verb ends with a double consonant, consonant cluster, or voiced
plosive (b / d), past tense will end in -et.
. If the verb ends in a single consonant (except v / b / d), past tense
ends in -te.
. If the verb ends with v or diphthong, the past tense ends in -de.
. If the verb has only one syllable with a long vowel, past tense ends
in -dde.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Rule Number* |*Infinitive* |*Past Tense* |*English*
.2+|*1* |Å sna[.underline]##kk##e |Snakket |_Talked_
|Å ø[.underline]##nsk##e |Ønsket |_Wished_
.2+|*2* |Å læ[.underline]##r##e |Lærte |_Learned_
|Å kjø[.underline]##p##e |Kjøpte |_Bought_
.2+|*3* |Å le[.underline]##v##e |Levde |_Lived_
|Å pl[.underline]##ei##e |Pleide |_Used_
|*4* |Å b[.underline]##o## |Bodde |_Lived_
|===

For future tense, typically the present tense verb is used with a time
adverbial to clarify it is a future action.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Eksempel* |*English*
|Hun kjører til Oslo i morgen. |_She is driving to Oslo tomorrow._
|Jeg jobber neste helg. |_I am working next weekend._
|===

### Adjective Basics

Adjectives typically have to agree with the gender and the number of the
noun.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| 2.+|*Singular Indefinite* 2.+|*Plural Indefinite*

| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*

.2+|*Masculine* |En rød fugl |_A red bird_ |Røde fugler |_Red birds_

|En grønn sirkel |_A green circle_ |Grønne sirkler |_Green circles_

.2+|*Feminine* |Ei rød hytte |_A red cabin_ |Røde hytter |_Red cabins_

|Ei grønn drakt |_A green costume_ |Grønne drakter |_Green costumes_

.2+|*Neuter* |Et rødt lys |_A red light_ |Røde lys |_Red lights_

|Et grønt rektangel |_A green rectangle_ |Grønne rektangler |_Green
rectangles_
|===

When the noun is in the definite form, the adjective usually takes an -e
ending (like in the plural indefinite above).

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| 2.+|*Singular Definite* 2.+|*Plural Definite*

| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*

.2+|*Masculine* |Den røde fuglen |_The red bird_ |De røde fuglene |_The red
birds_

|Denne grønne sirkelen |_This green circle_ |Disse grønne sirkelene
|_These green circles_

.2+|*Feminine* |Den røde hytta |_The red cabin_ |De røde hyttene |_The red
cabins_

|Denne grønne drakta |_This green costume_ |Disse grønne draktene
|_These green costumes_

.2+|*Neuter* |Det røde lyset |_The red light_ |De røde lysa / lysene |_The
red lights_

|Dette grønne rektanglet |_This green rectangle_ a|
Disse grønne rektangla /

rektanglene

|_These green rectangles_

## Norwegian Articles and Grammatical Gender

Unlike English, many languages have grammatical genders for their nouns.
And in many of those languages, it is fairly easy to recognize what
gender a noun is. Unfortunately, this is not the case with Norwegian.
Norwegian has three grammatical genders for words: masculine, feminine,
and neuter, and the only way to know which gender a noun is, is by
memorization. We’ll look at singular nouns first.

### Indefinite

The indefinite articles are: “en” for masculine gender nouns, “ei” for
feminine, and “et” for neuter.

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* In some dialects, “en” is used for feminine gender
nouns, instead of “ei.” This is also allowed for written bokmål.

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Masculine* |*English* |*Feminine* |*English* |*Neuter Gender*
|*English*

|En mann |_A man_ |Ei / en bok |_A book_ |Et hus |_A house_

|En katt |_A cat_ |Ei / en avis |_A newspaper_ |Et eple |_An apple_

|En bil |_A car_ |Ei / en hytte |_A cabin_ |Et kontor |_An office_
|===

The indefinite form of a noun is used similarly in Norwegian as in
English. However, when the noun is a profession, occupation, or office,
the article is dropped.

Ex. Jeg er elektriker.

I am an electrician.

### Definite

The grammatical gender of a noun determines the definite form of a word.
In the definite form, the indefinite article (for masculine and neuter)
gets added to the end of the word. For feminine nouns, the article
changes to “a” and gets added to the end.

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Masculine Gender* |*English* a|
*Feminine*

*Gender*

|*English* |*Neuter Gender* |*English*
|Mannen |_The man_ |Boka |_The book_ |Huset |_The house_
|Katten |_The cat_ |Avisa |_The newspaper_ |Eplet |_The apple_
|Bilen |_The car_ |Hytta |_The cabin_ |Kontoret |_The office_
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* If you use “en” in the feminine form for the
indefinite, then in the definite form, the “en” article gets added to
the end of the word (though some dialects use “en” for indefinite and
the -a ending for definite).

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Ei Indefinite* |*Ei Definite* |*En Indefinite* |*En Definite*
|*English Indefinite* |*English Definite*

|Ei kvinne |Kvinna |En kvinne |Kvinnen |_A woman_ |_The woman_

|Ei bokhylle |Bokhylla |En bokhylle |Bokhyllen |_A bookshelf_ |_The
bookshelf_
|===

I often see people ask how to learn the gender of the nouns. My
suggestion is to memorize the nouns in the definite form, then you will
know, based on the end of the word, what the word’s gender is. For
example, memorize “mannen” for “the man” instead of just memorizing
“mann.”’

### Plurals

Norwegian has three different forms for plurals: -(e)r; -e; and no
ending. The majority of nouns take the -(e)r ending in the plural form.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Ending* |*Singular* |*Plural* |*English*
.3+|*-(e)r* |En bil |Bil__er__ |_Cars_
|Ei hytte |Hytt__er__ |_Cabins_
|Et eple |Epl__er__ |_Apples_
.2+|*-e* |En finger |Fingr__e__ |_Fingers_
|Et øye |Øyne |_Eyes_
.3+|*No ending* |En fisk |Fisk |_Fish_
|Ei mus |Mus |_Mice_
|Et dyr |Dyr |_Animals_
|===

There are many nouns that have a vowel change in the plural form.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Ending* |*Singular* |*Plural* |*English*
.3+|*-(e)r* |En tann |Tenner |_Teeth_
|En hånd |Hender |_Hands_
|Ei bok |Bøker |_Books_
.4+|*-e* |En far |Fedre |_Fathers_
|En bror |Brødre |_Brothers_
|En mor |Mødre |_Mothers_
|Ei datter |Døtre |_Daughters_
.2+|*No ending* |En mann |Menn |_Men_
|Et tre |Trær |_Trees_
|===

Many nouns in the singular form, that end in -el, -en, or -er, drop the
-e- from the stem in the plural form. If the noun has a double consonant
in singular, it usually becomes a single consonant in plural.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Ending* |*Singular* |*Plural* |*English*
.2+|*-(e)r* |En sykkel |Sykler |_Bicycles_
|Et eksempel |Eksempler |_Examples_
.2+|*-e* |Ei datter |Døtre |_Daughters_
|Ei søster |Søstre |_Sisters_
|===

### Plural Endings in the Definite Form

The plural ending for most nouns in the definite form is -(e)ne for all
genders.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
|*Gender* |*Singular Indefinite* |*Plural Indefinite* |*Plural Definite*
|*English*

.3+|*Masculine* |En bil |Biler |Bilene |_The cars_

|En finger |Fingre |Fingrene |_The fingers_

|En mann |Menn |Mennene |_The men_

.3+|*Feminine* |Ei hytte |Hytter |Hyttene |_The cabins_

|Ei avis |Aviser |Avisene |_The newspapers_

|Ei datter |Døtre |Døtrene |_The daughters_

.3+|*Neuter* |Et eple |Epler |Eplene |_The apples_

|Et tre |Trær |Trærne |_The trees_

|Et eksempel |Eksempler |Eksemplene |_The examples_
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* Most neuter nouns can take an -a ending in the
definite plural form. A common one is for “child.”

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*
|*Singular Indefinite* |Et barn |_A child_
|*Plural Indefinite* |Barn |_Children_
|*Singular Definite* |Barnet |_The child_
|*Plural Definite* |Barna***** |_The children_
|===

*[.underline]#*NOTE:#* “Barnene” is allowed however it is not very
common.

### Compound Nouns

When a noun is a compound, it always takes the gender of the second noun
in the compound.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*First Noun* |*Second Noun* |*Compound Word* |*English*
|En skole |Et kjøkken |Et skolekjøkken |_A school kitchen_
|Et kjøkken |En kniv |En kjøkkenkniv |_A kitchen knife_
|===

### Adjectives

As we learned earlier, gender affects the adjectives that describe a
noun since the adjective typically has to agree with the gender and
number of the noun. For example, for neuter nouns, the adjective usually
gets a -t ending added. For plural nouns (regardless of gender), the
adjective usually takes an -e ending and the noun must retain the
definite article at the end. .

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Masculine* |*English* |*Feminine* |*English* |*Neuter* |*English*

|En stor bil |_A big car_ |Ei stor bok |_A big book_ |Et stort hus |_A
big house_

|Store biler |_Big cars_ |Store bøker |_Big books_ |Store hus |_Big
houses_

|Den store bilen |_The big car_ |Den store boka |_The big book_ |Det
store huset |_The big house_

|Den røde bilen |_The red car_ |Den røde hytta |_The red cabin_ |Det
røde huset |_The red house_

|De søte kattene |_The sweet cats_ |De gamle avisene |_The old
newspapers_ |De brune husene |_The brown houses_
|===

There are some exceptions to these rules. For additional information on
adjectives, check this
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bg71uhF2jXPyqo-9XGiP9mzs7cwEcTS2Zpo9D1YccDM/edit?usp=sharing[[.underline]#lesson#].

As seen in the above table, gender also affects what demonstrative
pronoun (den, det, de) is used when drawing attention to a specific
thing or when an adjective is used.

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Gender* |*Example* |*English*
.3+|*Masculine* |Den bilen er min. |_That car is mine._
|Denne bilen er min. |_This car is mine._
|Disse bilene er mine. |_These cars are mine_
.3+|*Feminine* |Den boka er mi. |_That book is mine._
|Denne boka er mi. |_This book is mine._
|Disse bøkene er mine. |_These books are mine._
.3+|*Neuter* |Det eplet er ditt. |_That apple is yours._
|Dette eplet er ditt. |_This apple is yours._
|Disse eplene er dine. |_These apples are yours._
|===

*[.underline]#NOTE:#* When a demonstrative pronoun is used, the noun
still takes the definite ending.

Additionally, gender determines what pronouns you use when you want to
express something belongs to you or someone else. Note that in
Norwegian, the pronoun is usually placed after the noun and the noun
retains the definite ending.

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Gender* |*Example* |*English*
.4+|*Masculine* |Katten min |_My cat_
|Hatten din |_Your hat_
|Bilen sin |_His / her / their (own) car_
|Hunden vår |_Our dog_
.4+|*Feminine* |Boka mi |_My book_
|Avisa di |_Your newspaper_
|Boka si |_His / her / their (own) book_
|Hytta vår |_Our cabin_
.4+|*Neuter* |Eplet ditt |_Your apple_
|Huset mitt |_My house_
|Barnet sitt |_His / her / their (own) child_
|Huset vårt |_Our house_
|===
*[.underline]#NOTE:#* “Sin / si / sitt / sine” are reflexive possessive pronouns,
meaning the subject of the sentence owns the object being discussed. If
the object belongs to someone other than the subject, then “hans /
hennes / deres” is used and it does not change based on the grammatical
gender of the object.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Eksempel* |*English* |*Eksempel* |*English*

|Han kysser kona sin. |_He is kissing his (own) wife._ |Han kysser kona
hans. |_He is kissing his (someone else’s) wife._

|Kvinna kjører bilen sin. |_The woman is driving her (own) car._ |Kvinna
kjører bilen hennes. |_The woman is driving her (someone else’s) car._

|Barnet spiller spillet sitt. |_The child is playing his (own) game._
|Barnet spiller spillet hans. |_The child is playing his (someone
else’s) game._

|Koret synger sangene sine. |_The choir is singing their (own) songs._
|Koret synger sangene deres. |_The choir is singing their (someone
else’s) songs._
|===

It is possible to put the pronoun before the noun (without the definite
ending), however this is usually only used when one wants to emphasize
who the thing belongs to.

Ex: Hunden min er brun. Vs Det er min hund!

My dog is brown. That is my dog!

The grammatical gender of the noun does not affect the possessive
pronoun, if the noun is plural. In this case, you just use “mine / dine
/ sine / våre” across all three grammatical genders.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Singular* |*English* |*Plural* |*English*

|Katten min |_My cat_ |Kattene mine |_My cats_

|Boka di |_Your book_ |Bøkene dine |_Your books_

|Hunden sin |_His / Her / Their (own) dog_ |Hundene sine |_His / Her /
Their (own) dogs_

|Huset vårt |_Our house_ |Husene våre |_Our houses_
