## Terms of Endearment

Here are some useful words to know to properly address someone’s
significant other.

First, we’ll learn the difference between these two words:

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|_Kjær (adjective)_ |Dear |_Kjære (used as noun)_ |Dear, honey
|===

Adjective: Jeg har deg kjær: I hold you dear

Noun: Jeg holder deg, kjære: I hold you, dear

Now we’ll learn the different types of people we can be close to.

|_Mora mi_ |My mother |_Faren min_ |My father

|_Elskerinne_ |Mistress (not BDSM) |_Elsker_ |Cheating (male) lover /

For past relationships, Norwegian uses ‘eks’ like shown below. Usually
the word ‘eks’ is used instead of using the full title.

_Note:_

[cols=",",]
|===
|_å hooke_ |To hook up
|===

In English, the word ‘to hook up’ can have ambiguous meaning, and this
follows the same in Norwegian. This verb can mean to make-out, to have
sex, or anything in between.

## Norwegian affection

In Norway, words for affection are not thrown around casually. Some
people may only say the following phrases once or twice in their
lifetime.

[cols=",",]
|===
|_Jeg liker deg_ |I like you
|===

This is the burgeoning of affection towards someone.

[cols=",",]
|===
|_Jeg er glad i deg / Glad i deg_ |I love you / I care about you
|===

Literal translation: I am happy in you

This means more than simply liking someone as it tells you care about
them on a deeper level.

This phrase is also used to tell family members you love them.

[cols=",",]
|===
|_Jeg elsker deg_ |I love you
|===

This is the ultimate phrase for love in Norwegian. It is something said
when someone feels just about ready to marry an individual. Sometimes it
is only said once and it’s expected to stand for a lifetime.

It can also be used to tell family members you love them. However, some
people feel uncomfortable saying this and will prefer using ‘Jeg er glad
i deg’ instead.

## Common Phrases

These phrases will be more commonly used than expressing love, but still
hold meaning of affection.

[cols=",,,",]
|===

|_Jeg savner deg_ |I miss you |_Jeg har savnet deg_ |I have missed you

|_Jeg lengter etter deg_ |I long for you |_Du betyr så mye for meg_ |You
mean so much to me
|===
