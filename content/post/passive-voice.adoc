Active and passive sentences are syntactically related.

* An active sentence tells who or what did something.
+
Ex: Markus vasker bilen.
+
Markus washes the car.

* A passive sentence tells us what happened and to who / what.
+
Ex: Bilen vaskes av Markus.
+
The car is washed by Markus.
<!--more-->

In the above examples, the active sentence tells us who is washing the
car: Markus. Meanwhile, the passive sentence tells us what is being
washed: the car. Basically, when using passive voice, one is emphasizing
the object of an action or the result of an action instead of who is
doing the action.

Typically, when an active sentence is turned into the equivalent passive
sentence, three things happen:

[arabic]
. The object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive
sentence.
. The subject of the active sentence becomes a prepositional complement
in the passive sentence.
. The verb changes from an active to a passive form.

There are two types of passive construction in Norwegian:

*-s passive:* Dørene lukkes kl. 7. The doors will close at 7.

*Å bli passive:* Dørene ble lukket nå. The doors were closed now.

There’s also a third construction which is not technically “passive
voice,” however it’s still listed in some grammar books.

*Være passive:* Dørene er lukket nå. The doors are closed now.

== The -s passive

The -s passive is formed by adding an -s to the end of the infinitive
verb. It is more limited in its usage.

[arabic]
. It is often used with instructions, recipes, news headlines, and legal
documents.
. It is often used in conjunction with modal verbs (i.e. kan, må, etc)
which express permission, obligation, prohibition, volition, etc.
. It can can also be used to express repeated or habitual actions and
with verbs expressing possession, and opinion.

*[.underline]#Note:#* Some verbs can only form the passive using -s, for
example eie (own), vite (know).

== The bli passive

This passive form is created by using a form of bli + past participle.
This is the most commonly used form of passive voice. (For information
on past participles, check this
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQM4okKpZAeT6o-pmgIhcof2GEw_f5BA5if58oqFE_4/edit?usp=sharing[[.underline]#lesson#].)

[arabic]
. The present tense “blir” can be used when referring to a future
activity or event.
. The infinitive “bli” is generally used after modal verbs that express
possibility, logical necessity, and future promises.
. The bli passive is used for past tense and composite tenses.

== The være passive

As mentioned, previously, while this is “technically” not a passive
form, it is listed with other passive forms in the grammar book, so I am
including it in this lesson. The være “passive” is formed by using være
+ past participle.

[arabic]
. When the participle is a verb - this construction usually describes
the result of a completed action; it emphasizes the state of something
instead of the action that brought it about.
. When the participle is an adjective - when the action is vague or
absent, the participle may take on the function of an adjective; it
remains in the -t form in both the singular and plural, regardless of
the noun’s gender.

.3+|Participle as a verb |Boken er oversatt. |_The book is translated._
|Måltidet er laget. |_The meal is cooked._
|Hunden er vasket. |_The dog is washed._
.4+|Participle as an adjective |Jenta er forelsket. |_The girl is in love_
|Jentene er forelsket. |_The girls are in love._
|Døren er stengt. |_The door is closed._
|Husene er solgt. |_The houses are sold._
