== Grammar Review

=== Sentence structure

While most Norwegian sentences use the subject-verb-object (SVO) word
order, like English does, Norwegian does have the V2 (verb second) rule.
If an adverbial phrase or subordinate clause is at the front of the
sentence, the subject and the verb have to switch places (this is called
“inversion”) so that the verb stays in the second position.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.2+|*SVO* |Markus flyttet til Oslo sist måned. |_Markus moved to Oslo last
month._

|Ellas familie reiste til Spania hver sommer da hun var ung. |_Ella’s
family traveled to Spain every summer when she was young._

.2+|*V2* |Sist måned flytta (flyttet) Markus til Oslo. |_Last month, Markus
moved to Oslo._

|Da Ella var ung, reiste Ellas familie til Spania kvar (hver)
somma(e)r. |_When Ella was young, her family traveled to Spain every
summer._
|===

If a sentence has more than one verb, the second verb will be in a
nonfinite form (e.g. å finne). If the sentence has inversion, then the
subject will come between the finite (i.e. conjugated) verb and the
nonfinite verb.

|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.2+|*SVO* |Jenta prøvde å sykle uten støttehjul i går. |_The girl tried to
ride her bike without training wheels yesterday._

|Emil liker å tegne når han har tid. |_Emil likes to draw when he has
time._

.2+|*V2* |I går prøvde jenta å sykle uten støttehjul. |_Yesterday, the girl
tried to ride her bike without training wheels._

|Når Emil har tid, liker han å tegne. |_When Emil has time, he likes
to draw._
|===

=== Verb Conjugation

Conjugating present tense of verbs in Norwegian is fairly simple. Most
present tense verbs just add an -r to the end of the infinitive.

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*

|Å kysse |Kysser |_Kisses / Kissing_ |Å svømme |Svømmer |_Swims /
Swimming_

|Å drømme |Drømmer |_Dreams / Dreaming_ |Å planlegge |Planlegger |_Plans
/ Planning_
|===

There are some exceptions / irregulars:

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*
|Å kunne |Kan |To be able to |Å måtte |Må |To have to
|Å skulle |Skal |To have to; to be going to |Å ville |Vil |To want
|Å være |Er |_To be_ |Å vite |Vet |_To know_
|===

Past tense conjugation is a bit more difficult, however there are some
guidelines (but keep in mind there are exceptions).

[arabic]
. If the verb ends with a double consonant, consonant cluster, or voiced
plosive (b / d), past tense will end in -et.
. If the verb ends in a single consonant (except v / b / d), past tense
ends in -te.
. If the verb ends with v or diphthong, the past tense ends in -de.
. If the verb has only one syllable with a long vowel, past tense ends
in -dde.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Rule Number* |*Infinitive* |*Past Tense* |*English*
.2+|*1* |Å lytte |Lyttet |_Listened_
|Å sparke |Sparket |_Kicked_
.2+|*2* |Å låse |Låste |_Locked_
|Å reparere |reparerte |_Repaired_
.2+|*3* |Å prøve |Prøvde |_Tried_
|Å eie |Eide |_Owned_
.2+|*4* |Å skje |Skjedde |_Happened_
|Å bry |Brydde |_Cared_
|===

For future tense, often the present tense verb is used with a time
adverbial to clarify it is a future action. (*[.underline]#Note#*: There
are ways to form future sentences using modals; that is covered in a
more in-depth lesson).

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Eksempel* |*English*

|Johannes drar til Oslo i morgen. |_Johannes is going to Oslo tomorrow._

|Jeg tar oppvasken senere i kveld. |_I’ll wash the dishes later
tonight._
|===


=== Adjective Basics

Adjectives typically have to agree with the gender and the number of the
noun. If the noun is neuter gender, then in the singular indefinite
form, the adjective takes a *-t ending*. In the plural indefinite, the
adjective takes an *-e ending*. Note there are exceptions.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| 2.+|*Singular Indefinite* 2.+|*Plural Indefinite*

| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*

.2+|*Masculine* |En svak uttalelse |_A weak statement_ |Svake uttalelser
|_Weak statements_

|En lang vei |_A long road_ |Lange veier |_Long roads_

.2+|*Feminine* |Ei svak unnskyldning |_A weak excuse_ |Svake unnskyldninger
|_Weak excuses_

|Ei lang linje |_A long line_ |Lange linjer |_Long lines_

.2+|*Neuter* |Et svakt spark |_A weak kick_ |svake spark |_Weak kicks_

|Et langt dikt |_A long poem_ |lange dikt |_Long poems_
|===

When the noun is in the definite form, the adjective takes an -e ending.

[cols=",,,,",]

| 2.+|*Singular Definite* 2.+|*Plural Definite*

| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*

.2+|*Masculine* |Den svake uttalelsen |_The weak statement_ |De svake
uttalelsene |_The weak statements_

|Denne lange veien |_This long road_ |Disse lange veiene |_These long
roads_

.2+|*Feminine* |Den svake unnskyldninga |_The weak excuse_ |De svake
unnskyldningene |_The weak excuses_

|Denne lange linja |_This long line_ |Disse lange linjene |_These long
lines_

.2+|*Neuter* |Det svake sparket |_The weak kick_ |De svake sparkene |_The
weak kicks_

|Dette lange diktet |_This long poem_ |Disse lange diktene |_These
long poems_

== Passive Voice

Active and passive sentences are syntactically related.

* An active sentence tells who or what did something.
* A passive sentence tells us what happened and to who / what.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*
|*Active* |Markus vasker bilen. |_Markus washes the car._
|*Passive* |Bilen vaskes av Markus. |_The car is washed by Markus._
|===

In the above examples, the active sentence tells us who is washing the
car: Markus. Meanwhile, the passive sentence tells us what is being
washed: the car. Basically, when using passive voice, one is emphasizing
the object of an action or the result of an action instead of who is
doing the action.

Typically, when an active sentence is turned into the equivalent passive
sentence, three things happen:

[arabic]
. The object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive
sentence.
. The subject of the active sentence becomes a prepositional complement
in the passive sentence.
. The verb changes from an active to a passive form.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
.4+|*Active* |*Subject* |*Active Verb* |*Object* |*English*
|Løven |jager / jaget |sebraen. |_The lion chases / chased the zebra._
|Karin |synger / sang |sangen. |_Karin is singing / sang the song._
|Nora |kjører / kjørte |bussen. |_Nora is driving / drove the bus._
|===

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
.4+|*Passive* |*Subject* |*Passive Verb* |*Preposition Complement*
|*English*

|Sebraen |jages / ble jaget |av løven. |_The zebra is being / was
chased by the lion._

|Sangen |synges / ble sunget |av Karin. |_The song is being sang / was
sung by Karin._

|Bussen |kjøres / ble kjørt |av Nora. |_The bus is being driven / was
drove by Nora._
|===

There are two types of passive construction in Norwegian:

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Construction* |*Eksempel* |*English*
|*-s passive* |Dørene lukkes kl. 7. |_The doors will close at 7._
|*Å bli passive* |Dørene ble lukket nå. |_The doors were closed now._
|===

There’s also a third construction which is not technically “passive
voice,” however it’s still listed in some grammar books.

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Construction* |*Eksempel* |*English*
|*Være “passive”* |Dørene er lukket nå. |_The doors are closed now._
|===

=== The -s Passive

The -s passive is formed by adding an -s to the end of the infinitive
verb. It is more limited in its usage.

[arabic]
. It is often used with instructions, recipes, news headlines, and legal
documents.
. It is often used in conjunction with modal verbs (i.e. kan, må, etc)
which express permission, obligation, prohibition, volition, etc.
. It can can also be used to express repeated or habitual actions and
with verbs expressing possession, and opinion.

[cols=",,",]

|===

*[.underline]#Note:#* Some verbs can only form the passive using -s, for
example eie (own), vite (know).

=== The Bli Passive

This passive form is created by using a form of bli + past participle.
This is the most commonly used form of passive voice. (For information
on past participles, check this
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQM4okKpZAeT6o-pmgIhcof2GEw_f5BA5if58oqFE_4/edit?usp=sharing[[.underline]#lesson#].)

[arabic]
. The present tense “blir” can be used when referring to a future
activity or event.
. The infinitive “bli” is generally used after modal verbs that express
possibility, logical necessity, and future promises.
. The bli passive is used for past tense and composite tenses.

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Usage* |*Example* |*English*

.3+|“Blir” - used for present tense (without a modal) and for a future
activity or event |Vi blir hentet på stasjonen. |_We’ll be picked up at
the station._

|Trehytten blir bygd (å bygge) i morgen. |_The treehouse will be built
tomorrow._

|Filmen blir anmeldt (å anmelde) neste uke. |_The film will be
reviewed next week._

|Turen må bli utsatt (å utsette). |_The trip must be delayed. (Seems

|Eksamen skal bli rettet (å rette) i morgen. |_The exam will be
corrected tomorrow. (i.e. promise)._

.3+a|
Bli passive also used for:

* Past tense
* Composite tense

|Oppfinnelsen ble godkjent (å godkjenne) av firmaet. |_The invention
was approved by the company._

|Eleven ble hjulpet (å hjelpe) av læreren. |_The student was helped by
the teacher._
|===

=== The Være “Passive”

As mentioned, previously, while this is “technically” not a passive
form, it is listed with other passive forms in the grammar book, so I am
including it in this lesson. The være “passive” is formed by using være
+ past participle.

[arabic]
. When the participle is a verb - usually describes the result of a
completed action; it emphasizes the state of something instead of the
action that brought it about.
. When the participle is an adjective - when the action is vague or
absent, the participle may take on the function of an adjective; it
remains in the -t form in both the singular and plural, regardless of
the noun’s gender.

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Usage* |*Example* |*English*

.3+|*Participle as a verb* |Boken er oversatt. |_The book is translated._

|Måltidet er laget (å lage). |_The meal is cooked._

|Hunden er vasket (å vaske). |_The dog is washed._

.4+|*Participle as an adjective* |Jenta er forelsket. |_The girl is in
love_

|Jentene er forelsket (å forelske). |_The girls are in love._

|Døren er stengt (å stenge) |_The door is closed._

|Husene er solgt (å selge) |_The houses are sold._
