One of the more challenging aspects of learning Norwegian is the varying
dialects. While Norway has two written standards, bokmål and nynorsk,
there is no spoken standard. For Norwegian learners, this can sometimes
make listening comprehension a difficult thing to master. For the more
advanced learner, they may want to pick a dialect to learn and use, so
they sound more “natural” when speaking Norwegian. 
<!--more-->
Today, we will look
at some of the more common dialects in Norwegian and how they
differentiate. This is just a very general overview; keep in mind there
are many more dialects than what is covered in this lesson, and that
some of the bigger dialects have dialects of their own (e.g. Trøndersk
spoken in the cities is different than the Trøndersk spoken in more
rural areas).

== Some Basic Info

There are four to six main categories of dialects in Norwegian (depends
on who you ask). These groups are:

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Category* |*Region* |*Some Examples of Dialects within the Category*
.2+|Nordnorsk .2+|Northern Norway |Bodø dialect
|Helgeland dialect
.2+|Trøndersk .2+|Central Norway |Fosen dialect
|Meldal dialect
.2+|Vestlandsk .2+|Western Norway |Bergen dialect
|Stavanger dialect
.2+|Østnorsk / Østlandsk .2+|Eastern Norway |Oslo dialect
|Østerdal dialect
.2+|*Midlandsmål .2+|Midland Norway |Bø dialect
|Gudbrandsdal dialect
.2+|*Sørlandsk .2+|Southern Norway |Arendal dialect
|Valle-Setesdalsk dialect
|===

* Midlandsmål & Sørlandsk are not counted as their own categories by
some people.

The categories can also be organized in this manner, (according to
some):

image::/images/dialects/media/image2.png[image,width=444,height=652]

The dialects can vary in accent, grammar, syntax, and even vocabulary.
The geography of Norway has played a large role in why the dialects vary
so much. Until the early 20th century, small communities were largely
isolated from one another, which often led to them developing
idiosyncrasies of their own. However, over the decades, as Norwegians
began moving around more, and interacting with people from different
areas, over time this influenced the different dialects. Smaller dialect
traits have been lost and many rural dialects have begun to merge with
the nearest larger dialects. This is called “regionalization.” There are
some people that are trying to preserve smaller, more rural dialects.

In the early 20th century, if one hoped to have upward social mobility,
conforming one’s dialect to riksmål was common. People from smaller
rural areas would also, often, change how they spoke if they were in
more formal types of settings. Even today, some Norwegians will alter
how they speak, switching to a form of Norwegian that is closer to the
written standards, if they are speaking to people from other parts of
the country.

It used to be that if someone spoke a dialect from northern Norway, they
might be discriminated against. For example, in Oslo, ads for places to
rent and for jobs sometimes said “Nordlendinger uønsket” (Northern
Norwegians unwanted). Nowadays, many see it as rude if you put someone
down for their dialect (not in a joking manner between friends), as it
is seen as criticizing someone’s identity. However, you will still hear
people sometimes criticize the Trøndersk dialect in general, saying it
is “ugly.”

== Some Traits Among (some of) the Different Dialects

There are some things that can clue a listener in as to what dialect is
being used. Please note that any written examples are not “standard” as
there are no written dialect standards. Some people may write in
dialect, informally, but how they choose to spell things can vary. Also
note that these are not exhaustive lists of traits and some traits are
found in multiple dialects.

=== Nordnorsk

* Hv- is usually replaced by a k-.

* The front vowels - i, y, e - are lower and are pronounced more like e,
ø, and æ respectively. (This is also found in Trøndersk).

* Nordnorsk dialects tend to have a very varied and colorful way of
insulting or swearing. They range from the very mild to the more
intense.

_Turnip peel_

|Refers to someone stupid |Kuklæst |_Cock sock_ |Refers to someone who

|Pong |_Ballsack_ |Refers to someone who is rude or an arse +
(less intense than the other 2) |Hæstkuk |_Horse cock_ |Refers to
someone who is rude or an arse. (Sometimes used jokingly with friends).
|===

* The word “fette” / “fett” / “fetta” (pussy) can be used as an
emphasizer; an insult; or just a swear word when you injure yourself or
something.
+
[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Nordnorsk* |*Usage* |*Nordnorsk* |*Usage*

|Fettkaldt / Fette kaldt |Extremely cold |Fettsygt / Fette sygt |Very

|Fettondt / Fette ondt |Very painful |Ei fetta |A pussy (used as an
insult).

|Fetta! |Exclamation when you hurt yourself, etc. |ise-hakke-fette-kaldt
a|
“Ice - chattering - pussy - cold”...

used as a description when it is extremely cold (because it is the
Arctic Circle). +
*Side note:* “Hakke-tenner” is when your teeth chatter when you shiver.

|===

* If you want to hear some more nordnorsk (with swearing), listen to
this https://youtu.be/TVjbIcuS4uI[video].

* There are a number of ways to say “drunk” in the nordnorsk dialects:
** Full
** Dritings
** Drita
** Maurings (used ironically or for emphasis; not common among younger
Norwegians).
** Kanon (rarely used)

* Infinitive verbs without a vowel ending are common in Nordland, a
county in northern Norway. Other counties use the -e ending for
infinitive verbs.

* Northern Norwegian dialects begin their sentences with a higher pitch
on the first word and then the tone decreases.

* Northern Norway uses gendered pronouns, “ho” / “han”, when referring
to inanimate objects, and it is as valid as using the (gender neutral)
inanimate pronoun “den”.
+

|*Bokmål* |*Dialekt* |*English*

|Boken du leser, ble du ferdig med den? |Den boka du læs, blei du færdi

Person 1: Hvor kjøpte du bilen?

Person 2: Jeg fant den i Hammarfæst.

|Person 1: Kor kjøpte du biln? +
Person 2: Eg fant han i Hammarfæst a|
_Person 1: Where did you buy the car?_

_Person 2: I found it in Hammerfæst._

|===

* It is more common to use all three grammatical genders (ei, en, et) in
nordnorsk dialects.

* People speaking in a northern dialect will place the gendered pronoun
before a person’s name when talking about them. (This is also found in
Trøndersk and Østnorsk).
+

lives?_

|Har du hørt noe fra Karl? |Har du hørt nakka fra han Karl? |_Have you

|===

* In the Tromsø dialect, sometimes a V3 rule is applied in questions.
(This is also found in many Trøndersk dialects).
+

|===

=== Trøndersk

* Trøndersk has many traits that make it distinguishable from other
Norwegian dialects.

* Hv- words are replaced with either k- or kv-.
+
Ex: Hverandre Kvarainner
+
Each other

* “Leveling” - where a vowel in the middle of the word and the vowel at
the end of the word become the same or very similar - is found in areas
around Trondheim. Not all Trønders do this, however.
+

|===

* Stress is always on the first syllable of the word, even with
loanwords.
+
Ex: Banan ['ban:an] instead of [bana:n]

* Palatalization of “n” and “l” is common in Trøndersk.
+

|===
|*Bokmål* |*Trøndersk* |*English*
|Vann |Vannj |_Water_
|Han |Hanj |_He_

* Trøndersk has 5 different L sounds:
** Voiced lateral alveolar approximant /l/ - often referred to as the
light L
** Voiced retroflex lateral approximant /ɭ/ - retroflex rl sound
** Voiced palatal lateral approximant /ʎ/ - palatal l / llj
** Voiced alveolar lateral fricative /ɬ/ - the / tl / sl sound (rare)
** Voiced retroflex flap /ɽ/ - the tjukk l

* Has a low-tone, where the sentence intonation is more even.

* If a verb is “short” in nynorsk in present tense, it is often
shortened in Trøndersk also.
+
[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Bokmål* |*Nynorsk* |*Trøndersk* |*English*
|Jeg trenger |Eg treng |Æ træng |_I need_

* There are three groups of verbs (this is also found in Østnorsk):
+
[arabic]
. Infinitive verbs ending in -a
. Infinitive verbs ending in -e
. Infinitive verbs that drop the ending

=== Vestlandsk

* Bergensk has the “skarre-r” (aka the French R)

* Bergensk only uses two grammatical genders for nouns: en / et

* Some forms of Bergensk use “sin” genitive, aka “garpegenitiv.” (This
trait is found in other areas of Norway as well, including in some parts
of Trøndelag).
+
[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Bokmål* |*Bergensk* |*English*
|Guttens bil |Gutten sin bil |_The boy’s car_
|Kvinnens frakk |Kvinnen sin frakk |_The woman’s coat_

|Er ikke |E’kkje / E’kke |_Is not_
|Har ikke |Ha’kkje / Ha’kke |_Has not_
|Skal ikke |Ska’kkje / Ska’kke |_Shall not_
|===

|Håve |_Head_ |No fær æ |_I’m leaving now._
|===

* The infinitive verb ending is with an -a in Stavanger and areas around
Bergen (but not in Bergen).

* Sentences begin with a high tone on the first word and then decreases,
like with northern Norwegian dialects.

* Stavanger often uses “stein” as a way to emphasize how good something
is.
+
Ex: Det er en steinfin bil.
+
That is a very nice car.

* Stavanger dialect often replaces the “k” in a middle of a word with a
“g.”

=== Østnorsk

* Vowels are more open in østnorsk dialects.

* Speakers of østnorsk dialects tend to speak fast

* Split infinitive verbs, that is some infinitive verbs (typically short
verbs) end with -a and others end with -e, are common in eastern Norway.

* Some østnorsk dialects are close to bokmål (but there is no dialect
that is exactly spoken bokmål).

* Østnorsk dialects don’t replace hv- with k- , unlike many other
dialects.

* Østnorsk dialects typically pronounce the final -r and final -t in
verbs, whereas they are often dropped in many other dialects.

* The feminine “ei” is often replaced with “en,” however in the
definitive form, the noun will still take the -a ending.

== Comparisons of some Common Words

Let us look at some comparisons of common words, such as pronouns,
question words, and the word for “not.”

=== Pronouns

Some of the most frequently used words in any language are pronouns -
how we talk about ourselves and those around us. There are many
variations of the pronouns throughout the numerous dialects in Norway.

=== Possessive Pronouns

Another common type of word we use in languages are possessive pronouns
- how we refer to the relationship between people and items. In
Norwegian, you will see there are many ways these are said, depending on
the dialect.

=== Interrogative Words

Interrogative words, also known as “question words,” are how we find out
information. In many dialects in Norwegian, the hv- words are said with
a k- instead.

[cols=",,,,,",]

=== Not

This single word can be pronounced a number of different ways throughout
Norway. Just look...

[cols=",",]
