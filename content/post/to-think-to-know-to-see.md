Some verbs in Norwegian have more than one word that can be used, but
when to use which word can be difficult. Three examples are “to think,”
“to know,” and “to see.”

**<span class="underline">  
To Think</span>**

In English, “to think” is used in different ways, such as to ponder, to
give an opinion on something, and as another way to say “believe.”
Norwegian, however, has multiple words that are used in these
situations, and when to use them is kind of strict.

**Å tenke**

-   Used to mean to think; to ponder.

-   It is referring to the mental process of thinking.

| **Example**                         | **English**                                 |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Tenker du på meg ofte?              | *Do you think of me often?*                 |
| Tobias tenker på filosofi hver dag. | *Tobias thinks about philosophy every day.* |

**Å tro**

-   Used when one wants to express belief about something, however there
    > is some uncertainty.

-   If, in English, you can replace “think” with “believe,” then this is
    > the word you need.

| **Example**                                    | **English**                                              |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Isabella tror at bursdagen hans er neste uke.  | *Isabella thinks (believe) his birthday is next week.*   |
| Ella trodde at han ville være hjemme allerede. | *Ella thought (believed) that he would be home already.* |

**Å synes**

-   Used to express an opinion based on experience or feeling. *(I’ve
    > experienced it and this is my feeling about it).*

-   In English, this form of “think” can sometimes be replaced by
    > “find.”

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Hun synes at det er interessant.</td>
<td><em>She thinks (finds) it is interesting.</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Å mene**

-   Mener is similar to synes but with a strong conviction.

-   Also used when you are “pretty sure” about something.

-   You know something from memory or have some confidence in what
    > you’re saying though you may not know with a 100% certainty
    > (whereas “tror” would seem like more of a guess).

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Jeg mener at filmen vant en Oscar.</td>
<td><em>I think (am pretty sure) that the film won an Oscar.</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>

**<span class="underline">To Know</span>**

“To know” is another one of those verbs in English that we use in
multiple ways. In Norwegian, however, there are different ways to
express “to know” depending on the circumstances.

**Å kjenne**

-   Used when you want to express that you know someone or you are
    > acquainted with someone or something.

-   It can also be used to express that one knows an area or place very
    > well.

| **Example**                                     | **English**                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Kjenner du Markus?                              | *Do you know Markus?*                                |
| Jeg kjenner Markus fra jobb(en).                | *I know Markus from work.*                           |
| Victor kjenner boken.                           | *Victor knows of (is familiar with) the book.*       |
| Lea kjenner byen godt fordi hun vokste opp der. | *Lea knows the city well because she grew up there.* |

**<span class="underline">NOTE 1:</span>** In English, we have the idiom
“To know someplace like the back of your hand.” In Norwegian, there is a
similar idiom: “Å kjenne noe som sin egen bukselomme”

**<span class="underline">NOTE 2:</span>** “Å kjenne” is never used with
hv- words.

Ex: Jeg kjenner hvor byen er. - **<span
class="underline">WRONG!</span>**

Jeg vet hvor byen er. - **<span class="underline">CORRECT.</span>**

I know where the city is.

**Å vite**

-   Used when one is referring to facts, specifics, or superficial
    > knowledge or wisdom of somethi*ng.*

| **Example**                      | **English**                          |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Vet du når bussen går?           | *Do you know when the bus goes?*     |
| Jeg vet ikke når filmen starter. | *I don’t know when the film starts.* |
| Vet du om vi har fri i dag?      | *Do you know if we have off today?*  |

**<span class="underline">NOTE:</span>** The only direct objects that “å
vite” can take are: Det, dette, noe, ingenting, alt, ting.  
Ex: Maja vet alt. Tobias vet ingenting.

Maja knows everything. Tobias knows nothing.

**Kunne**

-   Used when one wants to express that they know how to speak a
    > language.

-   Also used if someone knows how to do a certain skill.

-   Also used when one knows something by heart; it refers to more
    > thorough, in-depth knowledge of something.

| **Example**                | **English**                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Emilie kan (snakke) norsk. | *Emilie can speak Norwegian.*        |
| Han kan bussruten.         | *He knows the bus route (by heart).* |

**<span class="underline">NOTE:</span>** The verb for “to remember” is
“å huske” and “to memorize” is “å lære seg utenat” or “å pugge.”

</tr>
</tbody>

**<span class="underline">To See</span>**

The verbs for “to see” in Norwegian can be used kind of interchangeably
but not always.

**Å se**

-   Used when one is specifically referring to visually observing
    > something.

-   It is not usually used to refer to meeting with someone*.*

| **Example**                   | **English**                     |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Kan du se den røde bygningen? | *Can you see the red building?* |
| Han ser en hund i vinduet.    | *He sees a dog in the window.*  |

**<span class="underline">NOTE:</span>** “Å se” refers to the passive
process of just “seeing” whereas “å se på” refers to the more active
process of looking at something or watching something.

| **Verb**    | **Example**               | **English**                              |
|-------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Å se**    | Hun så bildet i boken.    | *She saw the picture in the book.*       |
| **Å se på** | Hun så på bildet i boken. | *She looked at the picture in the book.* |

**Å møte *eller* Å treffe**

-   Both “å møte” and “å treffe” refer to seeing someone, often by
    > chance but not aways.

| **Example**                        | **English**                             |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Jeg møtte Sofia på butikken i dag. | *I met (saw) Sofia at the store today.* |
| Han traff henne på biblioteket.    | *He met (saw) Emma at the library.*     |

**Å snakke med**

-   Used when referring to seeing someone and talking with the person.
    > It emphasizes that there was a conversation that took place.

-   Also used to refer to phone conversations.

| **Example**                             | **English**                                  |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Jeg vil gjerne snakke med direktøren.   | *I want to see / speak to the manager.*      |
| Lukas snakket med Mathias på telefonen. | *Lukas spoke with Mathias on the telephone.* |
