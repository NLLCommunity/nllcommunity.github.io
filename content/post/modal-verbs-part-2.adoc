== Grammar Review

=== Sentence structure

While most Norwegian sentences use the subject-verb-object (SVO) word
order, like English does, Norwegian does have the V2 (verb second) rule.
If an adverbial phrase or subordinate clause is at the front of the
sentence, the subject and the verb have to switch places (this is called
“inversion”) so that the verb stays in the second position.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.2+|*SVO* |Gustav løp et / en maraton i fjor. |_Gustav ran a marathon last
year._

|Maria studerte kjemi da hun gikk på universitetet. |_Maria studied
chemistry when she was in university._

.2+|*V2* |I fjor løp Gustav et / en maraton. |_Last year, Gustav ran a
marathon._

|Da Maria gikk på universitetet, studerte hun kjemi. |_When Maria was
in university, she studied chemistry._
|===

If a sentence has more than one verb, the second verb will be in a
nonfinite form (e.g. å finne). If the sentence has inversion, then the
subject will come between the finite (i.e. conjugated) verb and the
nonfinite verb.

|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.2+|*SVO* |Sara liker å spille fiolin om kvelden. |_Sara likes to play the
violin in the evening._

|Jakob prøvde å lære tysk før han reiste til Tyskland. |_Jakob tried
to learn German before he traveled to Germany._

.2+|*V2* |Om kvelden liker Sara å spille fiolin. |_In the evenings, Sara
likes to play the violin._

|Før Jakob reiste til Tyskland, prøvde han å lære tysk. |_Before Jakob
traveled to Germany, he tried to learn German._
|===

=== Verb Conjugation

Conjugating the present tense of verbs in Norwegian is fairly simple.
Most present tense verbs just add an -r to the end of the infinitive.

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English* |*Infinitive* |*Present* |*English*

|Å følge |følger |_Follows / Following_ |Å glemme |glemmer |_Forgets /
Forgetting_

|Å le |ler |_Laughs / Laughing_ |Å smile |smiler |_Smiles / Smiling_
|===

Past tense conjugation is a bit more difficult, however there are some
guidelines (but keep in mind there are exceptions).

[arabic]
. If the verb ends with a double consonant, consonant cluster, or voiced
plosive (b / d), past tense will end in -et.
. If the verb ends in a single consonant (except v / b / d), past tense
ends in -te.
. If the verb ends with v or diphthong, the past tense ends in -de.
. If the verb has only one syllable with a long vowel, past tense ends
in -dde.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|*Rule Number* |*Infinitive* |*Past Tense* |*English*
.2+|*1* |Å flytte |flyttet |_Moved_
|Å regne |regnet |_Rained_
.2+|*2* |Å bake |bakte |_Baked_
|Å leke |lekte |_Played_
.2+|*3* |Å lage |lagde |_Made_
|Å leie |leide |_Rented_
.2+|*4* |Å tro |Trodde |_Believed_
|Å bo |Bodde |_Lived_
|===

There are two ways to talk about future activities. Sometimes a present
tense verb + a time adverbial is used. Modal verbs are another way to
express future tense.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

|*Present Tense + Time Adverbial* |Kjører Thomas til Trondheim i morgen?
|_Is Thomas driving to Trondheim tomorrow?_

|*Modal Verbs* |Vennene skal fiske i helgen. |_The friends are fishing
this weekend._
|===

=== *Adjective Basics*

Adjectives typically have to agree with the gender and the number of the
noun. If the noun is neuter gender, then in the singular indefinite
form, the adjective takes a *-t ending*. In the plural indefinite, the
adjective takes an *-e ending*. Note there are exceptions.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| 2.+|*Singular Indefinite* 2.+|*Plural Indefinite*

| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*

.2+|*Masculine* |En stor hund |_A big dog_ |Store hunder |_Big dogs_

|En brun hest |_A brown horse_ |Brune hester |_Brown horses_

.2+|*Feminine* |Ei stor bygning |_A big building_ |Store bygninger |_Big
buildings_

|Ei brun kasse |_A brown box_ |Brune kasser |_Brown boxes_

.2+|*Neuter* |Et stort jordbær |_A big strawberry_ |Store jordbær |_Big
strawberries_

|Et brunt rektangel |_A brown rectangle_ |Brune rektangler |_Brown
rectangles_
|===

When the noun is in the definite form, the adjective takes an -e ending.

[cols=",,,,",]
|===
| 2.+|*Singular Definite* 2.+|*Plural Definite*

| |*Norwegian* |*English* |*Norwegian* |*English*

.2+|*Masculine* |Den store hunden |_The big dog_ |De store hundene |_The
big dogs_

|Denne brune hesten |_This brown horse_ |Disse brune hestene |_These
brown horses_

.2+|*Feminine* |Den store bygninga |_The big building_ |De store bygningene
|_The big buildings_

|Denne brune kassa |_This brown box_ |Disse brune kassene |_These
brown boxes_

.2+|*Neuter* |Det store jordbæret |_The big strawberry_ |De store jordbæra
/ jordbærene |_The big strawberries_

|Dette brune rektanglet |_This brown rectangle_ |Disse brune rektangla
/ +
rektanglene |_These brown rectangles_

== Modal Verbs

Modal verbs are a type of auxiliary verb that combine with an infinitive
verb (without *“å”*) or with a directional adverbial. They express the
speaker’s attitude, belief, intentions, recommendations, doubt, etc
about the activity. While there are other modal verbs, we are focusing
on _kan, bør, and får***.**_

**[.underline]#Note:#* Får was listed in the Norwegian Essential Grammar
book, however most sources do not list it as a modal.

*Quick note on sentence structure*

Unlike in other sentences that contain two verbs next to each other,
where the second verb is in the infinitive (e.g. without the present
tense -r ending) with the “å” infinitive marker, when a sentence
contains a modal verb for the first verb, the verb that follows it will
be in the infinitive but not have the infinitive “å” marker. Let’s look
at this comparison:

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English*

.3+|*Without Modals* |Marius prøvde å male en solnedgang. |_Marius tried to
paint a sunset._

|Karine likar å spela sjakk. |_Karine likes to play chess._

|Lukas byrjar å læra norsk førre / forrige uke. |_Lukas began to learn
Norwegian last week._

.3+|*WIth Modals* |Ella kan tegne veldig bra. |_Ella can draw really well._

|Karine kan spille sjakk. |_Karine can play chess._

|Lukas kan snakke norsk og tysk. |_Lukas can speak Norwegian and
German._
|===

In the above examples, the sentences that do not contain modal verbs
must have the infinitive marker, “å” between the conjugated verb and
nonfinite verb. In the examples with modal verbs, the infinitive marker
is not included.

=== Å kunne

Translates into “can” or “may” (as in possibility). It’s used for:

* Ability or skill - using “kunne” sometimes gives the impression of
caution
* Possibility or probability
* Permission or prohibition
* “Kunne” can be used for unfulfilled wishes

[cols=",,,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English* |*Use*

|*1* |Faren min kan lage mat. |_My father can cook food._ |*Ability or
Skill*

|*2* |Kunne du hjelpe meg litt? |_Can you help me a little?_ |*Ability
or Skill*

|*3* |Det kan snø i morgen. |_It may / might snow tomorrow._
|*Possibility or Probability*

|*4* |Barnet spurte: “Kan jeg leke ute?” |_The child asked, “Can I play
outside?”_ |*Permission or Prohibition*

|*5* |Moren sa: “Du kan leke ute.” |_The mother said, “You can play
outside.”_ |*Permission or Prohibition*

|*6* |Moren sa: “Du kan ikke leke ute nå.” |_The mother said, “You
cannot play outside now.”_ |*Permission or Prohibition*

|*7* |Hvis jeg bare kunne vinne i lotto. |_If only I could win the
lottery._ |*Unfulfilled Wish*

|*8* |Kan jeg lage maten med deg? |_Can I cook the food with you?_
|*Permission*

|*9* |Det kan ikke være så mye sol! |_There can’t be so much sunlight!_
|*(daNiAL) Possibility*
|===

=== Å bør

“Burde” often translates into “ought to” or “should” in English. It’s
used for:

* Advice or suggestions
* Moral obligation
* How thing should or ought to be in an ideal world

[cols=",,,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English* |*Use*

|*1* |Du bør gå hjem nå. |_You should go home now._ |*Advice or
Suggestion*

|*2* |Du bør prøve denne nye drinken. |_You should try this new drink._
|*Advice or Suggestion*

|*3* |Han bør ta bedre vare på kjæledyrene sine. |_He should take better
care of his pets._ |*Moral Obligation*

|*4* |August burde være en bedre leder. |_August should be a better
leader._ |*How Things Ought To Be*

|*5* |Folk bør være snille mot hverandre. |_People should be kind to
each other._ |*How Things Ought To Be*

|*6* |Det bør være en skiskytingleksjon i dag. |_There ought to be a
Biathlon lesson today._ |*How Things Ought To Be*
|===

=== Å få

“Får” translates to “may” or “manage.” It’s used for:

* Permission - can sometimes be used instead of “kan / kunne.”
* “To manage” or “to achieve” when it is followed by a past participle

[cols=",,,",]
|===
| |*Eksempel* |*English* |*Use*

|*1* |Får vi gå nå? |_May we go now?_ |*Permission*

|*2* |Du får ta litt kake. |_You can have some cake. +
(you have permission)_ |*Permission*

|*3* |Christian fikk fikset bilen forrige helgen. |_Christian managed to
get the car fixed last weekend._ |*“To Manage” / “To Achieve”*

|*4* |Tror du at han får gjort det i kveld? |_Do you think he’ll manage
to do it this evening?_ |*“To Manage” / “To Achieve”*
|===

=== Modals without Main Verbs

In some instances, a modal verb can be used without a main verb.

[cols=",,",]
|===
| |*Norwegian Example* |*English Translation*

.3+a|
Statement

* Oftentimes an adverb will clue you in as to what main verb is omitted.

|Onkelen min skal til Oslo i morgen.. |_My uncle is going to Oslo
tomorrow.._

|Jeg må hjem. |_I must go home._

|Eg vil til skulen |

a|
Hvor

* The missing verb will always be one of motion (i.e. “go,” “travel”)
toward something

|Hvor skal Monica? |_Where is Monica going?_

a|
Hva

* It is implied that the missing verb is “do”

|Hva skal du? |_What are you going to do?_

.3+a|
Hvorfor

* Must contain an adverb of place which implies motion (i.e. “dit,”
“hjem,” “bort”)

|Kunne |Kan |Kunne |Kunnet |_Can_
|Burde |Bør |Burde |Burdet |_Should_
|Få |Får |Fikk |Fått |_Might; may_
|===

=== Multiple Modals

Since Norwegian has infinitive and past participle forms of the modal
verbs, it is possible to have two modals in the same verb phrase.

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Combination* |*Norwegian Example* |*English Translation*

a|
Modal (present / past tense) +

modal (infinitive) + verb

|Hun *ville* _kunne_ klare det. |_She would be able to do it._

a|
Have + modal (past participle) +

modal (infinitive) + verb

|Han har *måttet* _kunne_ se det. |_He must have been able to see it._

|Modal (present / past tense) + have + modal (past participle) + verb
|Hun *ville* ha _kunnet_ hjelpe. |_She would have been able to help._
