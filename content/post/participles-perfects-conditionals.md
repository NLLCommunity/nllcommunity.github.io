## Present Participle

The present participle, in Norwegian, is the ending -ende. This is
equivalent to the English -ing, however unlike in English, it is not
used as frequently. In English, -ing can be used to denote a continuous
action, however that is not the case in Norwegian *(with a small
exception you will see in this lesson).* For information on continuous
action, see this [<span
class="underline">lesson.</span>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T64nO6Y6kGqsJp6GrwgA-VHd95z8-CRh1gR-O0DwmDg/edit?usp=sharing)

The present participle is used often in Norwegian as an adjective or to
express the effect a person or thing has.

| **Norwegian**                    | **English**                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Resultatene er **alarmerende**.  | *The results are alarming.* |
| Naboen er **irriterende**.       | *The neighbor is annoying.* |
| Filmen er **spennende**.         | *The film is exciting.*     |
| Øynene hennes er **fengslende**. | *Her eyes are captivating.* |

It can also be used as an adverb intensifies an adjective.

| **Norwegian**                                    | **English**                                               |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Kjøkkenet var **skinnende** rent.                | *The kitchen was spotlessly (literally “shining”) clean.* |
| Kvinnen spilte **kokende** varm kaffe på mannen. | *The woman spilled boiling hot coffee on the man.*        |

The present participle is used as a verb of motion or expression when it
follows “å komme.”

| **Norwegian**                      | **English**                        |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Han kom **syngende** inn i rommet. | *He came into the room singing.*   |
| Der kommer Lise **løpende**.       | *Here comes Lise running.*         |
| Hun kom **kjørende** til festen.   | *She came to the party. (driving)* |

**<span class="underline">Note:</span>** In English, one can form a
sentence like, “I saw a howling wolf.” While one can say this in
Norwegian, it is not recommended. Here’s a better way to phrase such a
sentence:

Jeg så en ulv som ulte.

I saw a wolf that was howling.

The present participle of the verbs “sitte,” “ligge,” and “stå” are
often used with the verb “bli.”

| **Norwegian**                                               | **English**                                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bøkene ble **liggende** på bordet fordi jeg glemte å rydde. | *The books were lying on the table because I forgot to clean.* |
| Han ble **sittende** og prate.                              | *He was sitting and talking.*                                  |

**<span class="underline">Note:</span>** In second example above, the
second verb (“prate”) is in the infinitive form. (i.e. no -r).

Occasionally, there are sentences in which a present participle can be
used as a noun (*gerund*). When it is used as a noun in this manner, it
does not inflect for number or gender.

| **Norwegian**                                   | **English**                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| De **reisende** måtte bytte tog.                | *The passengers (literally “those travelling”) had to change trains.* |
| De **forbipasserende** la ikke merke til henne. | *The passersby did not notice her.*                                   |

## Past Participle

In English, the past participle is the verb form that ends in -ed and is
used in the perfect and passive tenses (and sometimes as an adjective),
for example, “have you looked?” or “lost property.” In Norwegian, the
past participle is used in the present perfect and past perfect tenses,
as well as in [<span class="underline">passive
construction</span>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JzBvQcuFJ4y908dBdeDqmyavvZ3ik6Xu9ILUNRupJ2U/edit?usp=sharing)
when combined with “bli.”

Here is the rule of thumb on how to conjugate the past participle:

<tr class="odd">
<td></td>
<td>Å eie</td>
<td>Eid</td>
<td>Han hadde eid det gamle huset.</td>
<td><em>He had owned the old house.</em></td>

</ul></td>
<td>Å b<span class="underline">o</span></td>
<td>Bodd</td>
<td>Jens har bodd her hele livet.</td>
<td><em>Jens has lived here his whole life.</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**<span class="underline">Note:</span>** In some strong verbs, the vowel
will change in the past participle form.

| **Infinitive** | **Past Participle** | **English** |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Å hjelpe       | Hjulpet             | *Helped*    |
| Å vinne        | Vunnet              | *Won*       |

When the past participle is used as an adjective indefinite or plural
forms, the conjugation changes slightly.

<td>Blandede nøtter var den beste blandingen hun hadde laget.</td>
<td><em>Mixed nuts was the best mixture she had made.</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**<span class="underline">Note:</span>** Some strong verbs will change
the past participle ending to -ne when used as an adjective.

Ex: Bilen er stjålet. Den stjålne bilen.

The car is stolen. The stolen car.

## Present Perfect Tense

Though it is called “present perfect” it is a form of past tense. In
present perfect, the action that happened in the past has an impact on
the present. It is used similarly as it is in English and is pretty easy
to form in Norwegian. Simply, it is har / er + the past participle.

| **Norwegian**               | **English**               |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Jeg har spist.              | *I have eaten.*           |
| Han har hatt mange gjester. | *He has had many guests.* |
| Vi har vært i Oslo.         | *We have been to Oslo.*   |

**<span class="underline">NOTE:</span>** Some intransitive verbs
(meaning they do not have a direct object), particularly those referring
to motion or change often use “er” instead of “har.” .  
Ex: Hun er kommet hjem.

She has come home.

In questions starting with “Hvor lenge…?” (how long?), the present
perfect tense changes the meaning of a sentence.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Tense</strong></th>
<th><strong>Eksempel</strong></th>
<th><strong>English</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Past Tense</strong></td>
<td>Hvor lenge <strong>var</strong> du i Norge?</td>
<td><p><em>How long were you in Norway?</em></p>
<p><em>(you are no longer in Norway)</em></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td></td>
<td>Hvor lenge <strong>bodde du</strong> i Trondheim?</td>
<td><em>How long did you live in Trondheim?</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Present Perfect Tense</strong></td>
<td>Hvor lenge har du <strong>vært</strong> i Norge?</td>
<td><p><em>How long have you been in Norway?</em></p>
<p><em>(you are still there or have been there for a while)</em></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td></td>
<td>Hvor lenge har du <strong>bodd</strong> i Trondheim?</td>
<td><em>How long have you lived in Trondheim?</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**<span class="underline">Note:</span>** Present perfect can also be
used for an action in the near future, in a subordinate clause, if
completed before an action expressed in the main clause.

Ex: Når du **har lært** norsk, kan du få en jobb.

When you have learned Norwegian, you can get a job.

## Past Perfect (aka Pluperfect)

The past perfect is used to express an action in the past that took
place before another action indicated by the past tense. An example in
English would be, “I had seen the movie when it came out.” It is formed
by using hadde / var + past participle.

| **Norwegian**                             | **English**                                  |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Han hadde allerede spist da du ringte.    | *He had already eaten when you called.*      |
| Lukas fortalte oss at han hadde vært syk. | *Lukas told us that he had been sick.*       |
| Etter at vi hadde spist, gikk vi på kino. | *After we had eaten, we went to the cinema.* |

**<span class="underline">Note:</span>** The use of “var” (past tense of
“er”) follows the same rule in past perfect as it does in present
perfect, with regards to intransitive verbs (i.e. verbs without a direct
object).

The past perfect may also be used to describe hypothetical events.

| **Norwegian**                                             | **English**                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hvis du ikke hadde drukket, kunne du ha kjørt hjem.       | *If you hadn’t drank, you could have driven home. (But you did.)*   |
| Hun ville ha hjulpet deg hvis du hadde bedt henne om det. | *She would have helped you if you had asked her. (But you didn’t.)* |

## Conditional (aka Future of the Past)

Expresses a future action in relation to a point of reference in the
past; this is often used in indirect speech. It is formed using skulle /
ville + infinitive.

| **Norwegian**                               | **English**                                  |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Hun sa at hun skulle vente på posten.       | *She said that she would wait for the mail.* |
| Han fortalte meg at Erik skulle lese boken. | *He told me that Erik should read the book.* |

## Conditional Perfect (aka Future Perfect of the Past)

This tense is formed with skulle / ville ha + past participle. It has
two functions (and bear with me, I know this will sound confusing; the
examples will help better explain).

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Function</strong></th>
<th><strong>Eksempel</strong></th>
<th><strong>English</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Expresses action that should have been done, before something else happens, but was not done (yet).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Usually used with indirect speech, often with a declarative verb (e.g. “tror”, “si”, etc) in the main clause.</p>
</li>
</ul></td>
<td>Jeg skulle ha reparert bilen før ferien begynte.</td>
<td><em>I should have repaired the car before the holiday began.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td></td>
<td>Jeg trodde at han ville ha kjøpt en bil før semesteret begynte.</td>
<td><em>I thought that he would have bought a car before the semester began.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Used in a main clause which has an attached conditional clause with the verb in the past perfect tense that expresses a counterfactual situation in the past.</td>
<td>Hvis jeg hadde visst om sykdommen din, skulle jeg ha besøkt deg.</td>
<td><em>If I had known about your illness, I would have visited you.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td></td>
<td>Jeg skulle ha sett filmen hvis jeg hadde hatt penger.</td>
<td><em>I would have seen the film if I had had the money.</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Future Perfect (Futurum Perfektum)

This form is created by using skal / vil ha + past participle. It
expresses an action that lasts to, or has relevance for, a certain point
in time in the future.

| **Norwegian**                                            | **English**                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Når ferien begynner, skal han ha fullført eksamenen sin. | *When the holiday begins, he must have finished his exam.* |
| Han skal ha spist før programmet begynner.               | *He should have eaten before the program begins.*          |
\\

| **Present**             | Han spiser.          | *He is eating.*                |
| **Preterite**           | Han spiste.          | *He ate.*                      |
| **Present Perfect**     | Han har spist.       | *He has eaten.*                |
| **Pluperfect**          | Han hadde spist.     | *He had eaten.*                |
| **Future**              | Han skal spise.      | *He will eat.*                 |
| **Future Perfect**      | Han skal ha spist.   | *He’s supposed to have eaten.* |
| **Conditional**         | Han skulle spise.    | *He would eat.*                |
| **Conditional Perfect** | Han skulle ha spist. | *He should have eaten.*        |
